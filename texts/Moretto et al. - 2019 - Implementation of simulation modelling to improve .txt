  Abstract
  Background: Advanced physiotherapist-led services have been embedded in specialist orthopaedic and
  neurosurgical outpatient departments across Queensland, Australia, to ameliorate capacity constraints. Simulation
  modelling has been used to inform the optimal scale and professional mix of services required to match patient
  demand. The context and the value of simulation modelling in service planning remain unclear. We aimed to
  examine the adoption, context and costs of using simulation modelling recommendations to inform service
  planning.
  Methods: Using an implementation science approach, we undertook a prospective, qualitative evaluation to assess
  the use of discrete event simulation modelling recommendations for service re-design and to explore stakeholder
  perspectives about the role of simulation modelling in service planning. Five orthopaedic and neurosurgical
  services in Queensland, Australia, were selected to maximise variation in implementation effectiveness. We used the
  consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to guide the facilitation and analysis of the stakeholder
  focus group discussions. We conducted a prospective costing analysis in each service to estimate the costs
  associated with using simulation modelling to inform service planning.
  Results: Four of the five services demonstrated adoption by inclusion of modelling recommendations into
  proposals for service re-design. Four CFIR constructs distinguished and two CFIR constructs did not distinguish
  between high versus mixed implementation effectiveness. We identified additional constructs that did not map
  onto CFIR. The mean cost of implementation was AU$34,553 per site (standard deviation = AU$737).
  Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first time the context of implementing simulation modelling
  recommendations in a health care setting, using a validated framework, has been examined. Our findings may
  provide valuable insights to increase the uptake of healthcare modelling recommendations in service planning.
