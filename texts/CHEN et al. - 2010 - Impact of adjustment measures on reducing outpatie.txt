      Background As an important determinant of patient satisfaction, waiting time, has gained increasing attention in the
      field of health care services. The present study aimed to illustrate the distribution characteristics of waiting time in a
      community hospital and explore the impact of potential measures to reduce outpatient waiting time based on a computer
      simulation approach.
      Methods During a one-month study period in 2006, a cross-sectional study was conducted in a community hospital
      located in Shanghai, China. Baseline data of outpatient waiting time were calculated according to the records of
      registration time and payment time. A simulation technique was adopted to investigate the impact of perspective reform
      methods on reducing waiting time.
      Results Data from a total of 10 092 patients and 26 816 medical consultations were collected in the study and 19 947
      medical consultations were included. The average of the total visit time for outpatients in this hospital was 43.6 minutes in
      the morning, 19.1 minutes in the afternoon, and 34.3 minutes for the whole day studied period. The simulation results
      suggested that waiting time for outpatients could be greatly reduced through the introduction of appointment system and
      flexible demand-orientated doctor scheduling according to the numbers of patients waiting at different time of the
      workday.
      Conclusion Adoption of an appointment system and flexible management of doctor scheduling may be effective way to
      achieve decreased waiting time.

hospital admission in mainland of China. With the
reforms of the medical insurance system in China,
patients have more options to select institutions for their
consultation. Most patients want shorter waiting times
along with accurate diagnosis and treatment. Many
factors appear to contribute to the long waiting time.
These factors include, but are not limited to; the health
insurance system, the time sense of doctors and patients,
patients’ behavior while seeking consultation, and
insufficient outpatient service power. Increasing resources
is the easiest way to solve the long waiting time problem,
but resources are limited in mainland of China. It is
critical for managers to know how to allocate the limited
resources to the right place at the appropriate times. More
data are needed for policy-making evaluation before the
new plans are implemented, and simulation skill is a
suitable decision-making support tool.

The present study aimed to illustrate the distribution
characteristics of waiting time in a community hospital
located in Shanghai, China and explore the impact of
potential measures to reduce outpatient waiting time in
the studied hospital based on a computer simulation
approach.
