This paper discusses the question of how operational research in general, and discrete event simulation in particular, can
help to meet management challenges in hospital-based orthopaedics medicine. It focuses on the reduction of waiting
times for elective patients, both for a ﬁrst outpatient appointment and for the subsequent commencement of in-patient
treatment. The research is based on a series of projects carried out by students from the Department of Management
Science, University Strathclyde in Stobhill Hospital and the Glasgow Royal Inﬁrmary between 1999 and 2003. An
increasingly detailed and complex simulation model was developed for the musculo-skeletal service provided by these
hospitals. The paper discusses the application of a modelling methodology—based on the idea of requisite models
evolving over time—that is participatory, iterative and focused on enhancing the clients’ understanding of the main
performance drivers of the service. It concludes that this methodology ﬁts well with successful strategies to sustain
reductions in waiting times.
