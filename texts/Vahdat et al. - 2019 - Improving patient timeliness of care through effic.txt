   In this Appendix, the Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) model to optimise the outpatient clinic layout design problem is
explained. The MIP model is based on a continuous representation of facility layout problems where each unit can be located in any
place in the planar site as long as units are not overlapping and units remain inside the borders of the planar site. The parameters
related to the introduced MIP model include the features of the units to be located (see Table 1), minimum distances required
between units in x and y directions (δsij ), and frequency of ﬂows between pairs of units (f ij ), estimated with the discrete-event
simulation model.
                                                                                                                                       y
   The main decision within the facility layout problem is the placement of each unit i, as deﬁned by the centroid coordinates ðcxi ; ci Þ,
along the x-axis and y-axis. But there are additional decisions for each category of units. For standard-sized units, an additional
decision of placing the unit horizontally ðri ¼ 1Þ or vertically ðri ¼ 0Þ must be made. For variable-sized units, two additional
                                                                                               y
decision variables of interest are the length and the width of each unit i, denoted as ðlix ; li Þ.
   csi and lis can be used for obtaining the borders of each unit i and verifying overlap of the units. For instance the lower
                                                                 y   y
right corner of the unit i can be calculated as ðcxi þ lix =2; ci  li =2Þ. Correspondingly, the distances between the centroids,
for all pairs of units ði; jÞ are deﬁned as dij . A binary decision variable Zijs denotes the relative location of units i and j with
respect to the x-axis and the y-axis to prevent the overlap between the units. The variable is equal to 1 if unit i must precede
unit j in the direction s.


          Decision variables:
          Continuous decision variables:
          cis                                Coordinate of unit i centroid location in direction s. i 2 NnNf ; s 2 S
          lis                                Length of variable-sized unit i in direction s. i 2 Nv ; s 2 S
          dijs                               Rectilinear distance between centroids of units i and j in direction s. i 2 N; s 2 S
                                               dij is expressed as the sum of the rectilinear distances in x and y-directions. dij ¼ dijx þ dijy
          Binary decision variables:
          Zijs                               Binary variable indicating if unit i precedes unit j in direction s or not. i; j 2 N; s 2 S
          ri                                 Binary variable indicating if unit i is located horizontally or not. i 2 NnðNv [ Nf Þ


  The objective is to minimise the average distance travelled by patients within the clinic, as a function of the location of
the units. Thus, the objective function is calculated as the sum of the product of the frequency of the patient ﬂows and the
rectilinear (Manhattan) distance between the centroids for all pairs of units i and j.

Constraint (A4) incorporates the linear segmentation of the hyperbolic curve, developed by Sherali et al. (2003) and used by Meller et
al. (2007), for the lengths of variable-sized units. Instead of using a nonlinear (nonconvex and hyperbolic) area constraint,
            y
ai ¼ lix  li , the discretised polyhedral outer-approximation of the area constraint is used, as shown in constraint (A4). Unlike
Lacksonen (1994), constraint (A4) provides a purely linear approximation of the area constraint without involving binary variables.
                                          y
The Δ tangential supports to the curve li ¼ alxi limit the width and length of each unit in each direction. As shown in previous studies,
                                              i
the number of tangential supports can be limited to 50, ðΔ < ¼ 50Þ, while obtaining an accurate approximation (Sherali et al., 2003).
   For the variable-sized units, the upper and lower bounds on the lengths are calculated based on the permissible aspect ratio and
                                                                                                pﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ s
required area of the units. Speciﬁcally,the upper bound
                                                           can be calculated as ðubsi ¼ min      ai αi ; L Þ and the lower bound can be
deﬁned with the following equation lbsi ¼ 2ub

                                              s . Constraint (A5) conﬁrms that the lengths of the variable-sized units remain
                                                                i

between the permissible lower and upper bounds in both directions.
   Constraint (A6) ensures that all the variable-sized units remain inside the rectangular bounds deﬁning the outpatient clinic facility
ðLs Þ. Despite the initial deﬁnition of length and width for standard-sized units, these units can be placed in two diﬀerent
conﬁgurations, as deﬁned or rotated 90 . The concept of rotation of the departments inside the facility is incorporated in constraints
(A7)–(A10). With the use of a binary decision variable ri , the rotation should keep the standard-sized units inside the rectangular
bound of the outpatient facility represented in constraints (A7)–(A8) and decrease the absolute distance between units shown in
constraints (A9)–(A10). Since all the units are rectangular, considering two rotational options (horizontal and vertical) covers all the
possible conﬁgurations for each unit.
   Constraints (A11) and (A12) ensure that separation restrictions are satisﬁed and prevent the overlap of units, using the relative
locations, Zijs . δsij is added to ensure a speciﬁed distance, if required, between any two units i and j in direction s. More speciﬁcally,
constraint (A12) assures that either unit i proceeds unit j in one of the directions s, or unit j proceeds unit i.

   Additional logical constraints that tighten the feasible polyhedron for ﬁxed-location units and standard-sized units are added to
the formulation. Constraints (13)–(14) verify the sequence of two ﬁxed location units. If the centroid location of unit i proceeds the
centroid location of unit j, unit j cannot proceed unit i or Zjis ¼ 0. Constraints (15)–(16) regulates that if the summation of any two
standard-sized units’ lengths are greater than the length of the facility ðLs Þ in either direction, they cannot precede each other in that
direction.
   Constraints (17) and (18) are binary constraints for two decision variables of the model. Constraints (19) and (20) are trivial
constraints for standard-sized and ﬁxed-location units. Constraint (21) ensures that for standard-sized units that have ﬁxed
locations, the precedence of units (Zijs and Zjis ) do not change over the optimisation process.


Appendix B. Two-stage composition/decomposition heuristic
As shown in Figure B1, in the ﬁrst stage, each group of three exam rooms are paired with one physician work area unit, constructing a
pod. As a result, instead of optimising the position of every single unit in the layout, the positions of pods in relation to other main
units (i.e., waiting area, cast, X-ray, check-in, check-out, and elevator) are optimised. With this change, the problem size is reduced
signiﬁcantly leading to the problem being solved more eﬃciently.
   The intuition of creating pods is derived from the fact that in many outpatient clinics, a set of exam rooms are associated with a
physician work area, or oﬃce, for the purpose of minimising the walking distances for providers. In fact, layouts are designed in a
way such that each physician has access to a number of dedicated rooms. Depending on the clinic type, a physician may be assigned
to one or more exam rooms. In the studied clinic, each physician has access to a maximum of three exam rooms. Since the only ﬂow
that couples the exam rooms to each other is the ﬂow of the provider between exam rooms, when the rooms are aggregated to create
pods, the ﬂow frequency can be summed without misrepresenting the system. An example of a ﬁrst-stage layout solution, in which
pod locations are deﬁned, is shown in Figure B1(a).

Figure B1. Example of the two-stage composition/decomposition heuristic for the outpatient clinic layout problem. Note that
the units with (*) represent physician work areas.

  After the location of the pods and the main units are determined in the ﬁrst stage, next the pods are decomposed and the
problem of ﬁnding the best layout for each pod is solved in the second stage, as shown in Figure B1(b). The pods are
decomposed in such a way that the ﬁnal layout remains feasible, with no overlapping units, and the total cost of ﬂows
between the units is minimised.

                                                                                                        HEALTH SYSTEMS            183


   To build diﬀerent layouts for the units inside the pod, without signiﬁcantly altering the solution from that found in the
ﬁrst stage, a locally expanded space that extends beyond the initial location of the pods is deﬁned. More speciﬁcally, the
expanded space is deﬁned to be the area that would result from adding an additional exam room on any side of the pod (see
Figure B2). The MH solution procedure examines diﬀerent layouts of the three exam rooms and one work area that can
occur in this expanded space. These solutions are only deemed to be permissible if units do not overlap with main units (i.
e., cast, waiting area, radiology, check-in and check-out) or units from other pods and are not located outside of the facility
boundary. Examples of solutions for the layout of these units in the feasible space such that no units overlap with the check-
in space are presented in Figure B2. Since the search space, deﬁned by the diﬀerent pod layouts, is discrete and independent
for each pod, the solution to this stage can be obtained eﬃciently.
