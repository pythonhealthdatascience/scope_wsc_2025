                                                     Methods: DES models real‐world systems by simulating sequential events.
                                                     We constructed a DES model for thoracic, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic
                                                     surgeries summarized from a tertiary Chinese hospital. The model covers
                                                     preoperative preparations, OR occupation, and OR preparation. Parameters
                                                     were sourced from patient data and staff experience. Model outcome is OR

                                                     department, including: (1) improving preoperative patient preparation time;
                                                     (2) increasing PACU beds; (3) improving OR preparation time; (4) use of
                                                     new equipment to reduce the operative time of a selected surgery type;
                                                     three levels of improvement (slight, moderate, large) were investigated.
                                                     Results: The first three improvement scenarios resulted in a 1%–5% in-

                                                     operative time of the selected surgery types led to approximately 12%, 33%,
                                                     and 38% increases in gastrointestinal, thoracic, and orthopedic surgery
                                                     throughput, respectively. Moderate reductions resulted in 6%–17% in-
                                                     creases in throughput and slight reductions of 1%–7%.
                                                     Conclusions: The model could reliably reflect OR workflows of the three
