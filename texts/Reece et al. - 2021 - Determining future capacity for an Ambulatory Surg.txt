      was increased from three to four, while the Post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) remained
      constant at 14 beds. The model was queried to determine the number of patients who could
      receive care while minimizing the duration of crowding (occupancy 13 or greater) in the
      PACU, limiting mean total crowding time to one hour per week.
      Results: The simulation was validated against current practice, and determined that up to 50
      patients per day can be scheduled through four operating rooms, and the resulting mean
      crowded time in the PACU would be limited to approximately 59 min.
      Discussion: DES allows hospitals to support strategic decision making through providing
      predictions of system performance under a variety of loading scenarios. This allows hospital
      management planners to inform operations with robust analysis and have conﬁdence in the
      likely outcomes of policy.
