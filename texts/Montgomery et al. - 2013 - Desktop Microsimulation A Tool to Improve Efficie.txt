                          Requirements for Simulation Experiments in Healthcare Operations
Entities                 Definition: The items processed through the system and that use resources.
                         Represented in this model as:
                           • Patients
                           • Additional activities of front office staff :
                               Paperwork
                               Surgical scheduling
Resources                Definition: A person or item used by an entity to perform an activity.
                         Represented in this model as:
                           • Providers: 9 surgeons, 1 podiatrist, 5 mid-level providers
                           • 7 Nurses assigned direct patient care tasks
                           • 4 Nurses assigned to indirect patient care tasks
                           • 10 Front office staff members
                           • 3 Diagnostic x-ray technicians
                           • 3 Cast technicians
                           • 3 Occupational therapists
Layout and locations     Definitions:
                         Layout: An architectural rendering, built to scale, imported into the software
                            as the background for the animated study (Figure 1). This allows
                            researchers to assign varying speeds of travel for entities and resources.
                         Locations: Fixed points within the model where entities and resources may
                            complete activities at varying time intervals.
                         Locations represented in this model as:
                           • patient entrance and exit points
                           • 1 information desk with 1 information desk queue
                           • 5 check-in/check-out desks with 1 check-in/check-out desk queue
                           • 1 waiting area
                           • 19 exam rooms
                           • 3 x-ray rooms with 1 x-ray room queue
                           • 4 cast rooms with 1 cast room queue
                           • 2 occupational therapy (OT) rooms with 1 OT room queue
Path networks            Definition: The predefined course upon which entities and resources travel
                            between locations.
                         Represented in this model as: The patient and staff flow through 14 hallways
                            between 41 connected locations.
Arrivals                 Definition: The initiation of entities into the system.
                         Represented in this model as: Unique arrival cycles per physician per day of
                            week per hour were created that mimicked the volumes and variation
                            found in real patient arrivals. The model simulated a typical work week
                            with patients arriving Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
Shifts                   Definition: Each entity may be assigned to a separate work shift
                            characterized by days of week, start time, break time, and end times.
                         Represented in this model as: Used to account for the high variation in
                            surgeons’ clinic schedules. For example, Doctor A might work all day on
                            Mondays and half a day on Thursdays. Therefore, Dr. A would only enter
                            the model on Mondays and Thursdays.
Processing and routing   Definition: The identification of the actions performed by an entity at each
                            location and the instructions given each entity on where to go once all
                            activities as a given location are complete.
                         Represented in this model as:
                           • Processing logic statements that identify randomly produced wait times
                            based on theoretical distributions for physician–patient interaction times.
                           • Routing statements which specify locations where a patient must travel
                            based on predetermined entity attributes (Table 2).

                        Scenario 4    Modified the Base Case by reducing the casting suite from a four-room configuration to a
