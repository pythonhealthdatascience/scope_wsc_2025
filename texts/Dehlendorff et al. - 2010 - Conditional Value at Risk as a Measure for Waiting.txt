Abstract: The utility of conditional value at risk (CVaR ) of a sample of waiting times as a measure for
reducing long waiting times is evaluated with special focus on patient waiting times in a hospital. CVaR
is the average of the longest waiting times, i.e., a measure at the tail of the waiting time distribution. The
presented results are based on a discrete event simulation (DES) model of an orthopedic surgical unit at a
university hospital in Denmark. Our analysis shows that CVaR offers a highly reliable performance
measure. The measure targets the longest waiting times and these are generally accepted to be the most
problematic from the points of view of both the patients and the management. Moreover, CVaR can be
seen as a compromise between the well known measures: average waiting time and the maximum waiting
time.

1. Introduction

S   imulation studies are widely used in health care applications due to the large number of
    uncertainties involved. The complexity of these systems together with the physical and
legal constraints in the actual systems make simulation a very powerful tool for
experimentation to serve as a basis for analytic optimization methods [4, 9].
      Simulation models in health care applications are used both for optimization of existing
facilities [8] and in planning new facilities [18]. Ferrin and McBroom [8] maximized hospital
revenue by process improvements in the emergency departments. Length of stay (LOS), the
number of patients leaving without receiving care, the percentage of admissions accepted
and ambulance diversion hours were used as outcomes. Miller et al. [18] considered the
merging of six emergency departments into one and focused on the average LOS . Their
results show that the LOS can indeed be considerably reduced. They further show that the
distribution of LOS is right-skewed with a long tail. Jun et al. [14] reviewed the health care
simulation literature and concluded that simulation is often used to optimize allocations and
as a tool in staff planning. They cited various studies related to patient scheduling and to
staff sizing and planning. They also reported that many studies use trade-offs between the
utilization of doctors, rooms etc. and patients' waiting times as outcomes.
     Denton et al. [7] studied expected surgical suite waiting time, surgical suite idle time
and total overtime and used a linear trade-off combination of these measures as a single
measure. This linear combination is a cost measure which takes into account the discomfort
of patient waiting time and considers it together with the lost revenue corresponding to idle
surgical suite time and the cost of overtime.

322                                                     Dehlendorff, Kulahci, Merser and Andersen

     Cayirli and Veral [5] reviewed out-patient scheduling and summarized a number of
possible performance measures related to the quality of such systems. The time-based
measures included the mean, the maximum and the frequency distribution of the waiting
times. Their summary for the suggested performance measures showed that the majority of
studies used mean waiting time, total costs of waiting, percentage of patient waiting less
than a certain threshold, and the variation of waiting time.
      The main objective in this article is to compare Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR ) as
a optimization measure for patients' waiting time with existing measures and to report on
the performance of this new measure based on a specific case-study of an orthopedic
surgical unit. The concept of CVaR is formally introduced in section 3.1 and originates from
economics. CVaR was introduced by Rockafellar and Uryasev [21] as a measure to quantify
a distribution of losses; typically in portfolio scenarios. The measure was introduced as an
extension to Value at Risk ( VaR ), one of the most commonly used performance measures
in portfolio management. The CVaR criterion focuses on the right tail of the loss
distribution and provides a measure of the expected value of the highest losses. The CVaR
criterion has been used in a wide variety of applications (see for example [1, 10] and [27]),
but not in the context of our study. The suggested use of CVaR is for optimization of a
given system's performance in terms of waiting time and is relevant in cases where the
frequency of long waiting times is the primary concern.
     In this article, a discrete event simulation model of an orthopedic surgical unit in
Copenhagen, Denmark is presented as the case-study. The long term goal for the simulation
study is to minimize the total waiting time, with special focus on long delays. In the
case-study analysis of the uncertainties and behaviour of different performance measures
including CVaR under various resource and simulation settings are presented. Moreover,
CVaR is compared to other measures using this model as illustration. The article is
structured in the following way: Section 2 describes the case-study. CVaR is defined in
section 3 followed by section 4 where the performance measure is evaluated by considering
the simulation model under different resource and simulation setups. Finally the key findings
are summarized in section 5.

2. Simulation Model
     In this section, we present our case-study for evaluating the performance of the CVaR
waiting time criterion in the simulation of an orthopaedic surgery unit. The level of detail
of the model is intentionally kept low, since our main objective is to use it as an illustration
of the CVaR measure.

2.1. The Surgical Unit
     As in much of the rest of the world, over the past decade the Danish public health care
system has been subject to increasing demands for efficiency [14]. The system is now under
considerable pressure for higher throughput in order to reduce waiting lists. Avoiding or
reducing delays in the system is certainly one of the many options to reach this goal.
Furthermore, fewer and/or shorter delays may also increase patient satisfaction, an issue
that is central to today's quality and productivity improvement strategies in general.
     The case-study is a surgical unit, which is part of an orthopedic department at a
university hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. The unit undertakes both acute and elective
surgery and performs more than 4,600 operative procedures a year. While the patients come
from various wards throughout the hospital, the main sources of incoming patients are the
four stationary orthopaedic wards or the emergency care unit. The outpatients treated in

Conditional Value at Risk as a Measure for Waiting Time in Simulations of Hospital Units   323
outpatient clinics are not considered in this model but the resources shared between
outpatients clinics and the surgical unit are included. Also day-case surgery patients with
short recovery times are included in the model.
2.2. Model Description
     The conceptual model is outlined in Figure 1. It consists of three main modules: (1)
the incoming module with arrival and wards, (2) the surgical unit with preparation and
operating rooms and (3) the recovery. Module 3 is linked back to module 1, since the patients
return to the wards for final recovery and discharge.




 Figure 1. Conceptual model for an orthopedic surgery unit. The 3 modules are separated
 by vertical lines and the arrows indicate the patient flow.


     The simulation model is implemented in Extend TM version 6 [17] and controlled from
a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet with a Visual Basic for application script. The patient flow is
outlined in Figure 2. All patients are either acute or elective and are admitted to one of the
four stationary wards from where the patients are collected when an operating theater is ready.
Patients are then either sedated, sent to a preparation room and brought to the operating
room or brought directly to the operating room for sedation and preparation. The patients
are operated and hereafter attended to by an anesthesiologist before being moved to the
recovery room. As the patients are moved out of the operating room, cleaning and
preparation of the rooms for the next patients are started.
      The resource constraints in the system are process related: available surgeons for the
operation, a free recovery bed and an available porter for moving the patient to the recovery
room, etc. These resources are controlled by a central mechanism controlled by different
schedules, e.g., more resources during regular hours. Sharing between different specialties is
handled with the resource pools. In our model the resources include staff and physical
facilities such as operating rooms and recovery beds. It should be noted that some resources
such as surgeons, anesthesiologists, porters and recovery beds are shared with other
departments or procedures not directly related to the surgical unit.

2.3. Empirical Data
     Prior to the simulation study, a simple registration of the time from patients' arrival
atthe surgical unit until their departure to the recovery room was done by the staff for a
period of 3 months. The initial data set held no information on subprocesses, which implied
that a more elaborate registration system was needed. In the new registration system, the
nurses at the surgical unit recorded the patient flow through the unit from the ward to the
recovery room, i.e., each subprocess was recorded over a period of 1 month.
     The new data was validated on the data collected routinely by the staff prior to the
simulation study by comparing the total time spent at the surgical unit recorded in the two
data sets with a Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (K-S) goodness of fit test [6], which indicated no
significant difference. Furthermore, tests for correlation [12, 2] between processes in the new
data set indicated that the subprocess durations were statistically uncorrelated indicating
that subprocesses could be modeled individually.
2.4. Validation and Verification
     The model was inspected graphically by the management of the department to verify
the patient routing and the procedures. Animation was included in the model to assist and
simplify verification during the presentation of the model.
     Model validation corresponding to patient volume and waiting time was carried out by
comparing the simulation output with the observed data. All validation was carried out using
graphical methods (QQ-plots, density plots and histograms) and formal statistical tests (K-S
and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests [13]) with a significance level of 5%. A more elaborate
validation was also carried out corresponding to the scheme outlined by Sargent [22] and
although this concluded that the model was adequate, it is not presented in this article.
    The model parameters were calibrated on the individual processes and queuing times,
and finally validated on the total duration defined as the time from the patient leaving the
ward to the time the patient is moved to the recovery room. Figure 3 shows that the model
tends to mimic the system's overall behavior, which was confirmed with K-S and Wilcoxon

Conditional Value at Risk as a Measure for Waiting Time in Simulations of Hospital Units    325
tests indicating no statistical difference. The throughput, mixture of patients and
distribution of patients per day were validated as a part of the tuning and calibration process.
      The incoming rate of elective patients per day was shown to fit a discretized triangular
distribution, which was also validated by a K-S test. The acute patients were assumed to
have exponentially distributed inter-arrival times. K-S tests indicated that the distribution of
acute patients per day and the ratio of elective to acute patients were modeled adequately.
The acute incoming rate was much more volatile compared to the one for elective patients.
The coefficient of variation (CV ), which is defined as the standard deviation divided by
the mean, was 2.5 times higher for the acute patients compared to the elective patients. In
both cases the variation in the observed data set was large with CV greater than 90 %.

3. Performance Measures
      One of the most essential issues in any simulation study is to define sound and reliable
performance measures [19]. Each simulation run is summarized in a set of measures, which
characterizes the overall performance of the system. Often more than one measure is
investigated in order to quantify the objectives of the study, e.g., avoiding long waiting times
while keeping a certain level of patient throughput. In this paper Conditional Value at Risk
is introduced as a waiting time measure targeting the longest waiting times and compared
to other existing measures.
3.1. Conditional Value at Risk
     Conditional Value at Risk is a concept originating from finance as a measure of risk
[21, 15, 16]. For a distribution of waiting times, T , CVaR is defined as the expected value

326                                                            Dehlendorff, Kulahci, Merser and Andersen

of the (1  D )-tail of T , i.e., given as

                                    CVaRD (T )       E [T |T ! qD ],                                 (1)

where qD is the D -quantile, where P (T d qD ) D . For a sample of simulated waiting times,
Tx {t x 1 ,..., t xN } (obtained from the x th run), the CVaRD (Tx ) is estimated by

                                               1 ª§ iD      ·          N t º
                           CVaRD (Tx )             « ¨   D ¸ t xiD  ¦ xi »                         (2)
                                             1  D ¬© N     ¹        i iD 1 N ¼


with t x 1 d t x 2 d ... d t xN , iD is the index satisfying ia / N t D ! (iD  1) / N , t xiD is the
D -quantile and in economics denoted as the Value at Risk (VaR ). VaR is seen to be
indifferent to the shape of the (1  D )-tail, i.e., a given VaR value covers situations from
short (1  D )-tails to long (1  D )-tails. In most applications of CVaR the estimate is based
on the (1  D )100% 5% longest waiting times and in the following CVaR is therefore
estimated by equation (2) with D 0.95.
      For waiting times the VaR waiting time is the value of the D -quantile of the total
waiting times, e.g., for D 0.95, 95% of the patients have a total waiting time less than or
equal to VaR. CVaR is the average of the 5% longest waiting times, i.e., a measure about
the tail of the waiting time distribution. It is seen that CVaR is at least as large as VaR and
that the difference indicates the length of the tail, hence the two measures are correlated.
CVaR is seen to be more sensitive to samples with very long waiting times compared to VaR.
However, Webby et al. [27] noted that CVaR, as opposed to VaR, is more stable with
changes in the D -value. This can be explained by the fact that CVaR is an average of the
tail, whereas VaR is the quantile defining the tail. The quantile is likely to jump with a
small sample, whereas the average will shrink this effect.
     The rationale for introducing CVaR waiting time measure is that it is a well known
measure of risk in finance. It fits well in an optimization framework with the objective of
minimizing the overall waiting time while controlling the risk of experiencing very long
waiting times. The tail of the waiting time distribution in these studies is quite important
since as shown by Bielen and Demoulin [3], in terms of patient satisfaction, waiting time
influences satisfaction negatively. That is, longer waiting times decrease patient satisfaction
significantly. Using the average waiting time inherently imply that the distribution of the
waiting times is unimportant as long as the overall waiting time is low. This is, however, not
in accordance with patient satisfaction and quality perception. On the other hand the
maximum waiting time may be a too risk averse measure and could potentially confound
good settings with bad settings since it is based on only the most extreme observation.
     The benefits of using CVaR as performance measure are that it is easy to compute,
easy to interpret and targets the long waiting times. As mentioned above, if the mean waiting
time (denoted risk neutral) is used, an increase in the longest waiting times can be overlooked
since a shift in the tail may be averaged out by the rest of the distribution. On the other
hand, using the maximum waiting time (risk averse) may corrupt the results, since a single
long waiting time may be an outlier in an otherwise well performing setup. CVaR can be
seen as a compromise between the average waiting time (D 0) and the maximum waiting
time (1  1/ N  D  1), with (1  D ) reflecting the risk of long waiting times. Hence a low
D corresponds to a high risk of overlooking long waiting times since the importance of these
is low.

Conditional Value at Risk as a Measure for Waiting Time in Simulations of Hospital Units     327
3.2. Other Measures
     Other measures have been suggested in the health care literature, which are discussed
in the following. Tang et al. [26] presented mean residual life, i.e., the expected residual life
time given that a unit has lived a certain amount of time. In terms of waiting time this is
equivalent to the expected residual waiting time having waited a certain amount of time.
Length of additional stay ( LAS ) is another metric for measuring waiting times, Silber et al.
[24] defined it as the remaining length of stay ( LOS ) after the transition point at which the
stay becomes prolonged. A stay may become prolonged at the first time point, x , where the
probability of a total length of stay of x  y is greater than the probability for a LOS of
 y from the beginning. The test for the prolonging point is done with the Hollander-Proschan
test [11]. LAS is seen to be the mean residual life at the point where the stay becomes
prolonged. The rationale behind LAS is that if a stay is prolonged it is more likely to be
associated with a complicated case [24].
     Both LAS (the MRL at the prolongation point) and MRL are similar to the CVaR
measure. However, CVaR is the expected waiting time of the (1  D )100% longest waiting
times, whereas mean residual life at the D -quantile is the expected remaining waiting time
after having waited t xiD minutes. Silber et al. [24] suggested using the point at which a stay
becomes prolonged as the choice for D . This imply that for different setups the corresponding
 LAS ' s (or MRL ' s ) are the average residual waiting times for the prolonged stays, i.e., for
different D -values. Furthermore, the scale is different depending on the setting: in one case
it may the residual waiting time after having waited 30 minutes while in another it may be
the residual waiting time after having waited 60 minutes. For LAS and MRL in general
unlike for CVaR the interpretation is seen to be dependent on the distribution. This implies
that the scale and interpretation are maintained for different settings, which makes it suited
for use in optimization. Moreover, the distribution of waiting times may be on time, i.e. no
prolongation point is present, which implies that the LAS concept breaks down.
      From a quality point of view the waiting time may be more interesting than the residual
waiting time, since the patient's perception of the quality of the treatment is related to
his/her total waiting time and not the residual waiting time after having already waited for
 x minutes. In terms of waiting times the length of additional stay may not be as important as
for the length of a hospital stay, since the waiting time indicates something about the system's
performance and not of the severity of the operation or complications for the individual
patient. Moreover, the waiting time is the time between activities and hence complicated
cases have longer activity times and more difficult recovery, which do not influence the
waiting time. Silber et al. [24] used the LAS as an indicator of health care outcomes and
the measure is hence not targeted at evaluating a system's performance. The LAS
framework does not seem to be well suited for evaluating waiting times, whereas it is highly
relevant for seeking complicated hospital stays.

4. Case Study
     This section presents the performance measures by applying them to output from the
simulation model presented in section 2. The measures are initially examined under the
existing setup in terms of the variation from run to run and the sensitivity to length and
number of runs. They are then considered under different resource settings. The proposed
measure, CVaR, is analyzed and compared to other well known measures presented in
section 4.3.

328                                                    Dehlendorff, Kulahci, Merser and Andersen

4.1. Simulation Setup
     The simulation model is run for at least 300,000 minutes (see section 4.4). This
corresponds to 30 weeks with a warm-up period of 10,080 minutes (1 week) for each run.
In each run different performance measures are obtained as described in section 4.3. These
measures are summarized by their minimum, maximum, average and coefficient of variation
(sample standard deviation in % of the average) across runs.
4.2. Analysis Methods
     The results from the simulation model are analyzed using statistical test methods.
Wilcoxon two-sample tests [13] are used to compare two samples in terms of their location.
The test is a non-parametric test. Comparing two samples in terms of their distributions is
done with Kolmogorov-Smirnoff two-sample test [6], which is also a non-parametric method.
Here we compare the empirical distributions and test whether they can be assumed to be
identical. Significance of correlation coefficients is tested based on Spearman's rho [12, 2],
a non-parametric approach based on ranks. The main rationale for using non-parametric
tests is that they do not rely on specific distribution assumptions and are robust against
outliers. All data analysis was done in R version 2.7.1 [20].
     Densities functions are estimated with the density procedure from the stats-package
and plotted with the densityplot function from the lattice-package in R [20, 23] using the
default values. The defaults are a Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth, h 0.9n 1/5
 min[Vˆ x , IQRx /1.34], where x is the sample, which has sample standard deviation Vˆ x ,
inter-quartile range IQRx and sample size n (Silverman's rule-of-thumb) [25].
4.3. Performance Measures
      The main focus of the simulation study is on the waiting times defined as the time wasted
between processes and is measured in minutes. For each patient a number of waiting times
are identified: waiting time before the surgeon talks to the patient before sedation, waiting
time for the anesthesiologist, waiting time before operating room is ready and waiting time
for a porter and a free recovery bed, etc. The total waiting time for the j th patient in the
i th simulation run, tij , is estimated as the sum of K sub waiting times, tijk . The waiting
time measures considered in this article are
      z   Average waiting time, WT
      z   Maximum waiting time, MWT
      z   Conditional Value at Risk, CVaR, waiting time, CVaR (WT )
      z   Value at Risk, VaR, waiting time VaR (WT )

     Additionally total throughput (total number of patients treated, TT ) and percentage
of elective patients treated outside regular hours, EOUT , are considered. These measures
are included in the simulation study to ensure that the throughput remains the same and
the elective patients are treated outside regular hours, hence without creating additional
costs due to overtime. The average and maximum waiting times are frequently used measures
to quantify the waiting time [5]. VaR is included to highlight the additional information
contained in our main measure, CVaR, and to illustrate its close relationship to CVaR.
4.4. Run Length and Sample Size Analysis
    The first example consists of simulations on the system at its current configuration.
Here, the main objective is to examine the performance measures under different run lengths

Conditional Value at Risk as a Measure for Waiting Time in Simulations of Hospital Units   329
and numbers of repetitions (runs). Table 1 shows the summary for three types of simulation
runs for the system as it is: (1) 30-weeks simulation repeated over 100 runs, (2) 30-weeks
simulation repeated over 200 runs and (3) 60-weeks simulation repeated over 60 runs.
     From the first block in Table 1 it is seen that the total waiting times are highly skewed
with an average WT of around 31 minutes, a 95 % quantile of around 61 and a maximum
of 111 minutes. It is seen from the CV column in the first block in Table 1 that the most
varying measure is the MWT (CV 11.3%) followed by EOUT (CV 9.2 %). The
remaining four measures are comparable in terms of coefficient of variation
(1.5% d CV d 2.5%).

      Figure 4 illustrates the evolution of the CV ' s as the number of runs is increased. It
can be seen that all CV 's are stabilized after 70 runs, however subdivided into the two
groups as described previously. It can also be seen that the two upper curves take more runs
to settle in compared to the bottom four. Clearly the maximum waiting time is a measure

highly dependent on the simulation run, since it is the most extreme observation in each
run. The average waiting time is as expected the least varying measure, whereas the CVaR
and VaR are seen to vary almost equally much. Figure 4 indicates that the four best
performing measures have stabilized after 30-40 repetitions.

             for 6 performance measures.


     Figure 5 shows that a run-length of 300,000 minutes (30 weeks) seems to be adequate
for obtaining a low CV for 5 out of 6 measures (no significant improvements hereafter).
 EOUT is seen to be improving by more than 2%-points from 300,000 minutes to 600,000.
Simulating 30 weeks repeated 60 times is a good trade-off between simulation time and
precision for MWT , which leads to an approximate half width of a 95% confidence interval
for the average of MWT corresponding to 2.7% of its estimated value. For WT , TT ,
VaR and CVaR considerably fewer repetitions are needed. In fact Figure 4 suggests that
fewer than 20 repetitions will be sufficient.
     In the 100 run simulation of 30 weeks each CVaR is significantly correlated with VaR
(as expected), MWT and WT . Moreover, VaR is significantly correlated with WT ,
whereas TT is correlated both with EOUT and WT . The correlations are all positive,
which implies that higher throughput is associated with longer waiting times. The VaR is
seen to be uncorrelated with the MWT , whereas CVaR is. This in fact fits well with the
definition of CVaR and VaR. The connection between CVaR and WT and MWT was
shown in section 3.1.

4.5. Sensitivity to Changes in Resource Allocation
      The sensitivities of the measures to changes in resource allocation are analyzed by
changing the number of porters at the surgical unit in regular hours. Three porters are
available in regular hours in the current system described in section 4.4. This number is set
to 1, 2 and 4 in the following analysis. The porters are a relatively less costly resource to adjust
than the number of surgeons, nurses and operation rooms. The expectations are that lowering
the number of porters will increase the waiting times and decrease the throughput or increase
the percentage of patients being treated outside regular hours. Hence increasing the number
of porters may enable an increase in the incoming flow of patients without increasing the
waiting times if the remaining resources are underutilized in the current setup.
     Table 2 summarizes the results from 60 runs of 30 weeks for three different settings of
porters. It can be seen that having 2 or 4 porters are equivalent with the results for 3 porters
in Table 1, whereas having 1 porter clearly increases the waiting times in terms of the average,
CVaR and VaR waiting time. In the top part of Figure 6 the associated estimated density
functions indicate that 2-4 porters lead to equivalent waiting time distributions, whereas the
1 porter distribution seems to differ.
     With 1 porter it is observed that all measures besides the total throughput are changed
significantly (Wilcoxon two-sample test [13]: p  0.001) compared to having 3 porters. The
patients wait longer on average (8.56% increase on average), have higher maximum waiting
times (8.41 % increase on average), more patients are treated outside regular hours (19.41

332                                                     Dehlendorff, Kulahci, Merser and Andersen

% increase on average) and CVaR and VaR are increased significantly (7.53% and 6.97%,
respectively). Figure 6 shows that the primary change from 2-4 porters to 1 porter is a heavier
tail. This is reflected in the CVaR in Table 1 and 2, which show that the increase is around
2 times the increase in the average waiting time. The top part of Figure 6 shows that the
estimated density function with 1 porter is flatter around the peak and has a thicker tail,
which increase the CVaR more than WT . The increase by 5 minutes in CVaR from 3 to 1
porter corresponds to an increase in waiting time for the approximately 85 patients with the
5% longest waiting times of 7 hours. In our simulation study the difference in CVaR is
statistical significant, but the practical importance of the increase may be limited.

     Adding an extra porter does not shorten the waiting times (top block in Table 2), the
situation is comparable with the original 3 porter setting. The performance measures were
not significantly different. The lowest p-value is obtained for VaR with a p-value of 0.18.
Figure 7 furthermore shows that increasing the number of elective patients leads to a
significantly worse performance compared to both the 3 and 4 porter situation (for all
measures other than MWT ). The bottom part of Figure 6 indicates that the patients are
waiting longer on average as the incoming rate is increased and that the tail of the waiting
time distribution has the same length (MWT the same) but is heavier (VaR and CVaR
increased).

   patient load (bottom). Vertical lines correspond to mean waiting time (solid lines) and
   CVaR value (dashed lines). Poters 4a, 4b and 4c correspond to 4 poters with 7%, 14%
   and 29% more elective patients, respectively. The dashed area in the lower right of
   each panel is highlighted in the upper right.


      It can be seen that CVaR has a higher absolute increase compared to WT for the 3 vs.
1 porter comparison, showing that the 5 % longest waiting times are increased the most. For
increased patient input MWT does not increase, whereas CVaR and VaR do. This shows
that using the MWT as criterion for judging the waiting time performance is a poor choice
as it may not pick up differences in the waiting time distribution due the large uncertainty
on this measure of the extreme. Moreover, the MWT does not consider the shape of the
waiting time distributions, which may differ in the thickness of the tails but have the same
 MWT . It is seen that CVaR picks up the change in the distribution of waiting times by
using information from the whole tail rather than relying on the most extreme observation
in each run.

5. Conclusions
     The analysis of simulation studies needs reliable performance measures to answer the
relevant research questions. In this article CVaR is suggested as a measure of the tail
distribution of waiting times for a surgical unit with the objective of avoiding long waiting
times. Our analysis shows that CVaR is a reliable measure that is specific to the tail.
Moreover, CVaR can be seen as a compromise between the risk neutral average waiting time

334                                                     Dehlendorff, Kulahci, Merser and Andersen

and the risk averse maximum waiting time. The results presented in this article show that
using the maximum waiting time is a poor choice since it is highly variable and ignores
changes in the shape of the waiting time distribution.
The average waiting time is not always representative for the waiting times, since such
distributions often are skewed and long waiting times may potentially be more problematic
from the points of view of patients and management. The VaR criterion is a measure of a
quantile in the distribution but is indifferent to the tail distribution and does not quantify
the tail distribution. In terms of quality management with patient satisfaction as outcome
CVaR is highly relevant since it quantifies the problematic long waiting times. Moreover,
the CVaR criteria is more stable compared to VaR with respect to the chosen D -level
since it is a sample average. It has nice properties as it is easy to compute and interpret and
it is robust. CVaR of the waiting times may therefore be a relevant outcome in many quality
improvement studies within health care with the objective of reducing the risk of long waiting
times.
