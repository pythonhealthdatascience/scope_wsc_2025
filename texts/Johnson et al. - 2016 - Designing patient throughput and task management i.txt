     Table I below shows 25th, 50th, and 75th quartile values
for various de-identified physicians (PHYS) and physician
assistants (PA). From this table it can be confirmed that
follow-up visits generally take less time than initial visits.
Service times for each provider are calculated based on
patient type: initial visit vs. follow-up visit. These times are
represented by random variates that were fitted with the list
of actual process times. Additionally, the proportion of
patients who must receive imaging has a large effect on
overall patient flow. This proportion was calculated for each
provider, since different specialties will send patients to                                                 FIGURE II
