ABSTRACT
   In hospitals, the management of operating rooms faces a trade-off between the need
   to be responsive to emergency surgeries and to conduct scheduled elective surgeries
   efficiently. Operating rooms can be configured as flexible and handle both electives
   and emergencies, or as dedicated to focus on either electives or emergencies. With
   flexible rooms, the prioritization of emergencies over scheduled electives can lead to
   schedule disruptions. Focused rooms can lead to imbalances between capacity and
   surgery workload. Whereas hospital administrators typically handle this trade-off by
   employing either flexible rooms (complete flexibility) or dedicated rooms (complete
   focus), we investigate whether a combination of flexible and dedicated rooms (partial
   flexibility) could be a preferable alternative. The ensuing question is what is the right
   combination of flexible and dedicated rooms? A versatile simulation model is developed
   to evaluate different resource allocation policies under various environmental parameters
   and performance metrics, including patient wait time, staff overtime, and operating room
   utilization. The main result is that partial flexibility configurations outperform both
   complete flexibility and complete focus policies by providing solutions with improved
   values of expected wait time for both emergency and elective patients. [Submitted: July

820               Partially Flexible Operating Rooms For Elective and Emergency Surgeries


INTRODUCTION
The variety and cost of the resources involved in delivering health care services
pressure hospital management to be as efficient as possible, while being responsive
to patient needs. Operating rooms, also commonly referred to as surgical suites,
represent the largest cost center and source of revenue for hospitals (Macario, Vitez,
Dunn, & McDonald, 1995) and as such, draw a lot of managerial attention. Several
research papers in operations planning and scheduling have contributed to improve-
ments in the management of surgical resources. Broad reviews on this topic have
been conducted by Magerlein and Martin (1978), Smith-Daniels, Schweikhart, and
Smith-Daniels (1988), Blake and Carter (1997), Cardoen, Demeulemeester, and
Beliën (2010), and Guerriero and Guido (2011).
       Conflicting stakeholders’ objectives, numerous patient types and needs, along
with multiple sources of uncertainty complicate the management of operating
rooms. One widespread difficulty is the necessary handling of emergency patients
who arrive randomly and need timely access to an operating room for surgery.
The nature of emergencies requires that the hospital be responsive and provide
surgical resources as fast as possible, which can perturb the schedule and flow of
elective patients scheduled for surgery if both emergencies and elective patients
have access to the same operating rooms.
       To overcome the difficulties created by the conflicting needs of elective and
emergency surgeries, hospital administrators have considered separating the emer-
gency services by dedicating a set of surgical suites for emergency cases, which
aim at ensuring responsiveness to emergencies, while allowing the rest of the hos-
pital’s surgical resources to concentrate on being efficient in handling scheduled
electives. Haraden et al. (2003), and Ryckman et al. (2009) have recommended
dedicating operating rooms to emergency cases to avoid disruptions of elective
cases by emergencies, and to reduce system variability and smooth patient flow.
This idea has had some success in practice (e.g., Clark, 2009; Ritchie, 2011). Fer-
rand, Magazine, and Rao (2010) investigated the effects of such a change, from
having all the operating rooms configured as flexible (complete flexibility), han-
dling both electives and emergencies, to having all the operating rooms dedicated
(complete focus)—with some focused on electives and the remainder focused
on emergencies. The results support the notion of a trade-off between efficiency
toward electives and responsiveness to emergencies: shifting from complete flexi-
bility to complete focus, with the appropriate allocation of rooms to electives and
emergencies, results in a decrease of both average elective patients wait time for
service and average staff overtime, while emergency patients average wait time for
service increases.
       This paper investigates whether a partial flexibility policy could improve
a hospital’s responsiveness and efficiency when compared with two extremes:
complete flexibility and complete focus. In a partial flexibility policy part of the
resources are flexible and can accommodate both electives and emergencies, while
the rest of the resources are split between those dedicated to electives and those
dedicated to emergencies. We compare two configurations of partial flexibility:
(i) high partial flexibility with mostly flexible rooms and a few dedicated rooms
and (ii) low partial flexibility with mostly dedicated rooms and a few flexible

rooms. These two partial flexibility policies represent a shift from either complete
flexibility or complete focus, and one may be better suited than the other, so we
also compare them to each other. We give an outline of these configurations in
Figure 1 below.
       Based on our simulation study, we formulate two observations on the benefits
of partial flexibility in the presence of two priority classes and establish guidelines
on how to implement partial flexibility. Our intuition is that there is a trade-
off between disruptions of flexible servers and potential capacity imbalances of
dedicated servers. We provide insights on how a hospital could use partial flexibility
to balance responsiveness and efficiency. Specifically, if a few rooms are dedicated,
we identify whether they should be dedicated strictly to emergencies or to electives.
If a few rooms are flexible, we determine whether this should mean fewer rooms
dedicated to emergencies or fewer rooms dedicated to electives. Since the best
way to use resources might depend on the hospital’s capacity, the arrival rate of
emergencies, and the duration and variability of the surgeries to perform, we use
computational experiments to characterize how these input parameters affect three
performance measures: patient wait time, staff overtime, and room utilization.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Background: Focus and Flexibility
Since the objectives of responsiveness to emergency surgeries and efficiency in
handling elective surgeries are different and conflicting, one could argue that the
best approach to balance these two objectives is to separate the surgical services for

                                                                                            15405915, 2014, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/deci.12096 by University Of Exeter, Wiley Online Library on [25/02/2025].

these two streams of patients. In the supply chain literature, the need to adapt the
supply chain to be responsive for innovative products and efficient for functional
products is well established (Fisher, 1997). Hospitals have taken steps to focus some
resources for specific services. For example, Hyer, Wemmerlöv, and Morris (2009)
report on an empirical study to identify the potential financial and operational
benefits at a hospital that transformed its trauma center to ensure that the unit would
be focused in terms of resource, space, transformation processes and organization.
One measure of success was that the newly focused trauma center yields lower
length of stay with similar mortality levels, but the authors note that this success
could have resulted from other infrastructural support initiatives, rather than the
focus.
       Separating surgical resources to handle demand for electives and emergencies
may not yield the best possible results for patient wait times. The manufacturing
literature stipulates that a company will be better able to meet uncertain demand for
multiple products if it operates factories that can be flexible and produce several
products to avoid capacity imbalances and reduce variability through a pooling
effect. Jordan and Graves (1995) show that if each plant can produce a subset
of all products, each product is produced in a subset of plants, and these sub-
sets of products complement each other across the network of plants (a notion
they refer to as chaining), the company can meet final product demand almost as
well as with the more costly, completely flexible configuration where every plant
can produce every product. This argument supports the idea of partial flexibil-
ity. The notion that “a little flexibility goes a long way” (Bassamboo, Randhawa,
&Van Mieghem, 2010) has also been demonstrated in safety stock decisions in
a multilevel system (Baker, Magazine, & Nuttle, 1986), in postponement capac-
ity decisions for delayed product differentiation (Graman & Magazine, 2002), in
manufacturing network configuration (Kulkarni, Magazine, & Raturi, 2004), in
newsvendor networks (Bassamboo, Randhawa, &Van Mieghem, 2010), in mul-
tistage supply chains (Graves & Tomlin, 2003), and in parallel queuing systems
(Bassamboo, Randhawa, &Van Mieghem, 2012).
       The above-mentioned papers, however, do not consider the notion of product
prioritization. Ata and Van Mieghem (2009) identify conditions under which it
is best to serve two customer classes, express and regular demand, by either
dedicating resources or using an integrated network that contains some flexible
resources capable of processing either customer class. Express demand has priority
over regular demand. Using Brownian models and large deviations analysis, they
find that an integrated network makes it possible for firms that serve mostly regular
demand to offer greater quality of service, as measured by responsiveness or delay,
almost independently of the correlation between express and regular demand. In
our context, this again supports using some flexible surgery rooms to serve both
scheduled and emergency surgeries.


Partial Flexibility for Operating Room Planning and Scheduling
In reviewing the literature on the different ways to handle emergency interferences
of scheduled elective surgeries, we found that in spite of a large body of research
on operating room planning and scheduling, the majority of the research does not

Ferrand, Magazine, and Rao                                                          823


consider emergency surgeries. Rather, the focus is almost exclusively on electives
surgeries. For example, in the literature review by Cardoen et al. (2010), only 17 of
the 121 papers reviewed were classified as addressing emergent or urgent patients.
Planning decisions may be classified by time frame (Gupta, 2007): (i) long term,
including capacity choices on number of surgical suites and types of surgeries;
(ii) medium term, including operating room allocation and use; and (iii) short
term, such as scheduling. Our research focuses on capacity allocation decisions
(medium term), taking inputs from long-term decisions. These capacity decisions
subsequently have an effect on how the short-term scheduling decisions are made.
      For capacity decisions, research has addressed the issue of balancing
emergency-surgery responsiveness and elective-surgery efficiency by either ded-
icating some capacity (e.g., Haraden et al., 2003; Bowers & Mould, 2004;
Bhattacharyya et al., 2006; Li & Stein, 2008) or by giving priority to emer-
gencies when capacity is shared with elective surgeries (e.g., Gerchak, Gupta, &
Henig, 1996; Marcon & Dexter 2006; Wullink et al., 2007; Ferrand et al., 2010;
Zonderland, Boucherie, Litvak, & Vleggeert-Lankamp, 2010). Yet, in these papers
capacity is either strictly dedicated or entirely shared among electives and emer-
gencies. Only a few papers use a mix of dedicated and shared capacity (Zhang,
Murali, Dessouky, & Belson, 2008; Persson & Persson, 2010). In these studies,
the operating time of the shared rooms is strictly divided between electives and
emergencies, so that part of the day is dedicated to electives and the rest of the
day is dedicated to emergencies. As such, the effect of emergencies is different
than in our setting where emergencies could access any flexible room as soon as it
becomes available. We contribute to the research that considers using a combina-
tion of flexible capacity and dedicated capacity by studying how policies of partial
flexibility can achieve a better balance between efficiency and responsiveness than
either complete flexibility or complete focus.
      For scheduling decisions, similar approaches have been studied as those
for capacity decisions: either partition the operating room time into elective and
emergency surgery time (e.g., Lamiri, Xie, & Zhang, 2008; Hans, Wullink, Van
Houdenhoven, & Kazemier, 2008; van Oostrum et al., 2008), or accommodate
emergencies in the time frame where electives have been scheduled (e.g., Van der
Lans et al., 2008; Pham & Klinkert, 2008). None of the scheduling efforts consider
a framework where some of the surgery room capacity is flexible and the rest of
the capacity is dedicated to either elective or emergency surgeries.
      Overall, the literature indicates that the question whether partial flexibility
can improve a hospital’s responsiveness and efficiency in handling emergency and
elective surgeries is yet to be answered. Given the benefits of partial flexibility that
have been documented in manufacturing and service operations (e.g., Jordan &
Graves, 1995; Akçay, Balakrishnan, & Xu, 2010), we investigate whether, when,
and how much a partial flexibility policy can help surgery planning in hospitals.

824               Partially Flexible Operating Rooms For Elective and Emergency Surgeries


Characteristics of the Simulated Operating Theatre
To investigate partial flexibility, we develop a simulation model based on the
operating theatre described in Ferrand et al. (2010). Our simulation model does
not contain all the complexities of an actual operating theatre. Rather, it is a stylized
model set up to study the effect of various room allocation policies to characterize
the trade-off between efficiency and responsiveness and capture the benefits of
partial flexibility. There are several complexities we are not considering:
r Fixed cost: we do not consider the costs of configuring the operating rooms to
  be flexible or dedicated. In practice, flexible rooms may be more costly to set up,
  since they need to accommodate both elective and emergency surgeries. Such
  costs considerations would imply a trade-off between the cost and the benefits
  of increased flexibility.
r Set up time: the turnaround time of the operating room is embedded in the
  procedure time of the surgeries, and we assume that the procedure times of
  elective and emergency surgeries are not affected by the room configuration.
r Patient flow: we assume that all patients can leave the operating rooms once
  the surgery is completed. This is to avoid the confounding effect of boarding
  situations, where patients have to remain in the operating room because no bed
  in the post-anesthesia care unit is available upon surgery completion.
r Schedule of elective patients: we keep the schedule of electives constant, to
  avoid the confounding effect of changing schedules in addition to room dedica-
  tion/flexibility choices, and we assume that no change can be made in real time
  to the schedule in reaction to variability in procedure time or the presence of
  emergency surgeries.

       There are 20 operating rooms, numbered 1 through 20, which are used
daily over an 8-hour shift plus possible overtime. The system starts empty and
idle every morning, and runs until all patients are cleared out of the system.
We use 16 consecutive weeks of available hospital data to model arrivals and
processing of emergency and elective surgeries. The data indicated that there are
75 elective surgeries scheduled over the 8-hour shift, while an average of 12
emergency surgeries are performed, with only minimal variation in surgeries per
shift (coefficients of variation of 0.12 and 0.15, respectively). In our study, the goal
is to spread the expected workload of the 75 elective cases fairly evenly throughout
the 8-hour shift. Hence, we model elective arrivals in batches of 15 patients, with
a fixed inter-arrival time of 90 minutes. The first batch arrives at the start of the
operating day, and the last of the five batches is expected to be completed 30
minutes prior to the end of the shift. Late arrivals and no-shows were reportedly
minimal for the operating theatre for which we got patient data, so we initially
assume that scheduled electives all arrive on time for their surgeries and we do
not have no-shows. We later test the effect of elective cancellations. Emergencies
can arrive at any time throughout the day. Since a Poisson process is a common
assumption for the arrival of random events (Gupta, 2013), we assume emergency
surgery arrivals can be modeled as a Poisson process. Given 12 emergencies per
day, we first use a constant arrival rate of 1.5 emergencies per hour, and later test
the effect of a nonstationary arrival rate.

                                                                                         15405915, 2014, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/deci.12096 by University Of Exeter, Wiley Online Library on [25/02/2025].

Ferrand, Magazine, and Rao                                                        825


       Historical data also provided total weekly workload for electives and emer-
gencies, so in conjunction with the weekly number of cases we derived the average
procedure time per surgery during each week (total hours/number of cases). Over
the 16 weeks, the aggregate average surgery time is close to 1.5 hours for electives,
and about 2 hours per emergency surgery. These weekly averages are very stable
across the 16 weeks, with coefficients of variation of 0.06 and 0.13, respectively.
For procedure time distributions, we used the Lognormal distribution, as it has
been found to be representative of surgical time distributions (e.g., Zhou & Dex-
ter, 1998; May, Strum & Vargas, 2000; Wullink et al., 2007). For each of the 16
weeks, we only have aggregate data on total weekly workload corresponding to a
number of weekly cases, which precludes us from obtaining an accurate measure
of surgery-duration variability. For procedure time variability, we used the coeffi-
cients of variations for elective and emergency surgeries from the study of Wullink
et al. (2007). Hence, in the base case, procedure times for elective surgeries follow
a lognormal distribution with a mean of 93 minutes and a standard deviation of
28 minutes, and a lognormal with a mean of 125 minutes and a standard deviation
of 92 minutes for emergency surgeries. All times are identical and independently
distributed (i.i.d.). It is fair to assume that the procedure times are independent of
each other provided that the surgeons are able to perform surgeries in a similar
fashion throughout the day. Average operating room utilization in the base case is
approximately 80%, which is representative of other hospital settings. A utilization
of 75% or greater can be considered moderate to high (Dexter, Macario, Traub,
& Lubarsky, 2003), and it should not exceed 85–90% to avoid significant delays
(Tyler, Pasquariello, & Chen, 2003). We conduct sensitivity analyses to test the
robustness of our results to changes in the emergency arrival pattern and volume,
and to changes in the elective surgery procedure time and cancellations.
       The setup of this operating theatre presents a combination of factors that
makes using a simulation model an attractive choice over analytical methods,
such as queuing theory. A specific difficulty lies in the assignment of elective
patients to operating rooms, which varies to reflect the changes in the number of
dedicated and flexible rooms available to the two patient classes. Moreover, we
are investigating a system that is transient in nature, thus ill-adapted to steady-
state queuing theory. Finally, our investigation enables more information than
existing queuing approximations, which typically focus solely on expected values.
We characterize the right-hand side tail of patient wait time, which is especially
critical for emergency patients. Overall, discrete event simulation is well suited to
the complexities of the hospital environment where it is crucial to understand the
impact of organizational changes on patients and staff before they are carried out.


Resource Allocation Policies
Under complete flexibility, elective and emergency surgeries share operating rooms.
Electives are scheduled across all operating rooms, and emergencies can access
any of these rooms. In reality, physicians are often assigned operating time in
a specific operating room to conduct surgeries, a practice referred to as block
scheduling. This assignment is often conducted well in advance of the surgery day.
To reflect this practice in our model, electives are assigned to a specific operating

                                                                                            15405915, 2014, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/deci.12096 by University Of Exeter, Wiley Online Library on [25/02/2025].

room upon entry into the system without regard to the current status of the system,
and wait in the queue that corresponds to this specific room. We could also envision
a system where electives wait in a single queue for the next available room, which
would be a distinct reality from what we model. Clearly, with electives waiting
in a single queue, the disruptions from emergencies would not negatively affect
electives as much as in our system’s configuration. The 75 electives are assigned
in a cyclic fashion through the set of twenty operating rooms: the first elective
is assigned to room 20, the second to room 19, etc.; once 20 electives have been
assigned, the cycle repeats and the 21st elective in then assigned to room 20, etc.
Meanwhile, emergencies wait in a single queue and seize the first operating room
that becomes available. Emergencies have priority over electives, but do not pre-
empt elective surgeries that are in progress. If more than one room is available when
an emergency arrives, the emergency goes to the room with the lowest number.
        Under complete focus, emergencies and electives have access to separate
subsets of rooms. Electives are assigned to an operating room in a similar fashion
as in the the flexible policy, but they access fewer rooms overall. Emergencies still
seize the first operating room available, but only considering the rooms included
in the subset dedicated to them. Based on the computational experiment in Ferrand
et al. (2010), we found that an allocation of five rooms to emergencies and 15 rooms
to electives is effective in balancing the trade-off between elective and emergency
patients wait time, given the input conditions on the total elective and emergency
workload. In particular, dedicating one more room to emergencies resulted in a very
small decrease in emergency patient wait time relative to the increase in elective
patient wait time, and dedicating one more room to electives produced a similar
phenomenon for elective wait time, relative to emergency wait time. Therefore,
per Ferrand et al. (2010), we dedicate 5 of the 20 rooms to emergencies in the
complete focus policy.
        To implement partial flexibility, we must decide how many rooms to ded-
icate to emergencies (nEM ), how many rooms to make flexible (nF ), and how
many to dedicate to electives (nEL ). Given this notation, we use the generic form
(nEM /nF /nEL ) to refer to a room allocation combination. As such, the complete
flexibility policy is (0/20/0), and the complete focus policy is (5/0/15). Since
the total number of rooms is fixed at N = nEM + nF + nEL , there are only two
decision variables. We built the simulation model so that we could easily evaluate
system performance with different combinations of dedicated and flexible rooms
by simply entering the number of rooms to dedicate to emergencies (nEM ) and to
electives (nEL ) as input parameters.
        Given the number of rooms in each subset, we assign elective and emergency
patients accordingly. Upon an emergency arrival, if an emergency-dedicated oper-
ating room is available we always assign the emergency to the available dedicated
room with the lowest number. If no dedicated operating room is available (includ-
ing if nEM = 0), and if at least one flexible room is available, then we assign the
emergency to the available flexible room with the lowest number. If all the rooms
are occupied, emergencies wait in a single queue for the next available room. Since
electives are assigned without regard to the current status of the system upon their
arrival, we cannot decide whether or not to assign electives to flexible rooms based
on the current status of the dedicated rooms. Instead, we devise an assignment rule

that adapts to the number of rooms available to electives and makes reasonable
use of those rooms. This assignment of electives to rooms could be improved
by allowing real time adjustments, but these adjustments would add noise in our
comparisons of room allocation combinations. We use the following simple heuris-
tic to assign the electives to the (nF + nEL ) rooms:
r If nEL < batch size for elective arrivals, then at each batch arrival nEL elec-
  tives are assigned to the dedicated rooms, the remaining electives are assigned
  cyclically to the nF rooms.
r If nEL ≥ batch size for elective arrivals, then the electives are assigned cyclically
  to the (nF + nEL ) rooms.
       With this heuristic, in the first case we ensure that the rooms dedicated to
electives are used, while the electives that cannot be accommodated in dedicated
rooms are distributed evenly across the flexible rooms. In the second case, applying
the first rule would result in no elective being assigned to the flexible rooms, and
implies that electives cannot get access to the flexible rooms since we do not alter
the assignment of electives to rooms in real time based on the status of the system.
As such, following the logic from the first case would revert to the complete focus
policy, with electives only assigned to elective rooms and emergencies accessing
rooms that never handle electives. This could result in no flexible room being used,
unless there are emergencies, thus converting the flexible rooms to emergency-
dedicated rooms. Instead, the second rule allows for some electives to access the
flexible rooms and distributes electives evenly across the rooms available to them.
Flexible rooms thus serve the same role as under the complete flexibility policy,
with emergencies having priority in accessing those rooms, even if electives are
waiting for the flexible room they have been assigned to. We recognize that with
this second rule, an elective could be assigned to a flexible room even though a
dedicated room is available, but this is a limitation of assigning the electives upon
their arrival without regard to the current status of the system, not a limitation of
our heuristic. More generally, it could happen that an elective batch is spread out
over more flexible than dedicated rooms, but since we keep cycling, this will be
compensated by other batches where electives are spread over more dedicated than
flexible rooms. Overall, this discussion shows that the assignment of patients to
rooms is not trivial, because it depends on the room allocation combination. Our
rules to assign patients to rooms reflect this interdependence, and overall we seek to
have consistent assignment rules across the various room allocation combinations
considered, so that changes in the performance results are primarily due to the
room allocation decisions.
       Now, the second rule only comes into effect when the batch size is less than
nEL . With the batch size fixed at 15 in this study, this condition is not fulfilled in the
majority of the simulation experiments; the sole exception is combination (4/1/15).
Hence, our results are overall unaffected by any difference due to switches between
assignment rules. For the combination (4/1/15), the cyclic assignment applies as
follows: the first batch is assigned to rooms 20, 19, ..., 6 (elective rooms); the
second batch is assigned to rooms 5 (flexible room), 20, 19, ..., 7; the third batch is
assigned to rooms 6, 5, 20, ..., 8; etc. As such, the flexible room provides some relief

to the elective rooms, and it does not affect emergencies much, because when the
flexible room becomes available, emergencies have priority over electives assigned
to it. Electives assigned to this flexible room are not affected much either, because
there are four emergency rooms, so emergencies will not be using the flexible room
much.


Performance Metrics and Experimental Design
We model the set of operating rooms with the resource allocation policies described
above using Arena, version 12.0. We verify the model using well-documented tech-
niques (e.g., Kelton, Sadowski, & Swets, 2009), including testing the model under
specific input parameter values. We validate the model by comparing historical
data on utilization to the utilization output from the simulated setting.
      For each room allocation combination in our computational experiment, we
collect the following performance metrics to capture both responsiveness and effi-
ciency: average, 75th and 95th percentiles of the wait time in queue for elective and
emergency patients, total staff overtime, average number of rooms with overtime,
and average room utilization during the 8-hour shift. Total overtime captures the
magnitude of overtime, while the average number of rooms with overtime gives
an indication of the spread of overtime across the rooms. In practice, there may be
surgeries that run so much longer than anticipated that other cases would be can-
celled to avoid excessive overtime, but for comparison purposes we do not consider
this eventuality. Also, note that we record utilization only during the 8-hour shift
because during overtime the utilization is 100% until all the work assigned to the
room is completed. Hence, this utilization measure can be compared across room
allocation combinations because the denominator remains constant at 8 hours in
the utilization calculation. As such, utilization gives us an indication of how busy
the system is during the regular hours, which correlates negatively with the amount
of overtime across room allocations. Furthermore, overtime correlates positively
with elective patient wait time, since the higher the elective wait time, the more
likely it is that the elective surgery is not completed during regular time.
      The half-width of the 95% confidence intervals of initial runs indicated that
400 replications would narrow the half-widths enough for comparison purposes
(between 5% and 20% of the estimated output value). We use common random
numbers as a variance reduction technique to increase the precision of our compar-
isons across the design points of our experiment (Law & Kelton, 2000). We embed
a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code in our Arena model to implement our
heuristic for the cyclic assignment of electives according to the number of rooms
allocated to each of the three subsets (nEM , nF , and nEL ).
      We first test the robustness of our results by fitting a nonstationary arrival
rate for emergency surgeries. We based this arrival rate on an analysis of one
year of patient arrivals to a local emergency department (ED) associated with
this operating theatre, and focused on the hourly arrivals during the 8-hour shift
from this ED, representing approximately 12,000 arrivals. Given the previously
established average of 1.5 emergency arrivals per hour for surgery, we scaled the
observed hourly arrival rate to the ED accordingly and use a piecewise stationary
Poisson process with a different arrival rate every hour ranging from 0.72 surgeries

to 1.76 surgeries per hour. The variations in the hourly arrival pattern from this
ED were similar to those reported for the national average by Pitts, Niska, Xu, and
Burt (2008), with peaks in the late morning and early evening. Applying the hourly
variations in ED arrivals to the arrivals of emergencies to the operating theatre is
an approximation because these two arrival processes may not be the same. In fact,
emergency arrivals to the operating theatre may not only come from the ED, but
also from a referring physician, ICU patients, and inpatients.
      We also consider the effect of elective surgery cancellations by factoring in a
17% cancellation rate, established by several previous studies (e.g., Hand, Levin,
& Stanziola, 1990; Lacqua & Evans, 1994). We model those cancellations as no-
shows upon their scheduled arrival time, thereby reducing the number of elective
surgeries by 17%.
      We also investigate the effects of three factors relating to patient volume,
procedure time duration, and variability. First, we increase the arrival rate of emer-
gencies by 50% to study how well the system performs under increased pressure
from emergencies. We do this under both stationary and nonstationary emergency
arrivals. Then we modify the elective procedure time distribution parameters, and
look at two cases: we increase both the mean and the standard deviation by 50%,
so that the coefficient of variation (CV) remains constant; and we increase the stan-
dard deviation only, so that the CV increases from 0.3 to 1.0. Lastly, we decrease
both the mean and standard deviation of elective procedure times by 25%, so that
the CV remains constant. The three factors, the different levels considered, and the
design of the experiment are presented in Table 1, where Case 1 is the base case
scenario.

RESULTS: BENEFITS OF PARTIAL FLEXIBILITY
Achieving High Partial Flexibility by Dedicating Operating Rooms
When comparing output performance measures across room allocation combi-
nations, a statistically significant change between two estimates is indicated by
95% confidence intervals that do not overlap. Accordingly, in the following

                                                                                            15405915, 2014, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/deci.12096 by University Of Exeter, Wiley Online Library on [25/02/2025].

results, when we state that there is no change in a given performance measure,
it is because the confidence intervals overlap. The results for the base case input
conditions (Case 1 in Table 1) for all the different room allocations are reported
in Table 2. Averages and percentiles are reported together with the half-width of
their 95% confidence intervals.
       Departing from the complete flexibility policy (0/20/0), we begin by ded-
icating a room, one at a time, to either electives or emergencies. We find that
dedicating one room to emergencies (1/19/0) reduces the average wait time of
electives, while average wait time of emergencies remains unchanged. We discuss
the reasons for this counter-intuitive result in the section “Observations on the
Benefits of Partial Flexibility.” Considering the 75th and 95th percentiles of wait
time for these two allocations, we find no significant change moving to a single
dedicated room. However, total overtime is reduced. Conversely, dedicating one
room to electives (0/19/1) does not provide any improvement, compared to the
complete flexibility policy (0/20/0). Once a room has been dedicated to emer-
gencies (1/19/0), we compare dedicating a second room, either to electives or to
emergencies. In assigning the second dedicated room, we find similar results as
when we dedicated the first room: dedicating the room to emergencies (2/18/0)
reduces average elective wait time and total overtime without affecting average
emergency wait time, while dedicating the room to electives (1/18/1) does not pro-
vide any improvement. We observe similar results when we dedicate a third room,
as shown in Table 2. However, after three rooms have been dedicated to emergen-
cies, the benefits of dedicating an additional room become insignificant, consistent
with diminishing returns from dedicating rooms to emergencies. Overall, the last
column of Table 2 indicates that average utilization remains stable, except for the
combinations (6/14/0) and (7/13/0), and these exceptions are discussed later in
this section.
       Comparing high partial flexibility with the combination (3/17/0) to the com-
plete flexibility policy (0/20/0), we find that average elective wait time decreases
23%, from 28.2 to 21.8 minutes, the 75th percentile decreases 12%, from 34.0 to
29.9 minutes, and the 95th percentile decreases 30%, from 152.5 to 106.1 minutes.
Meanwhile, average emergency wait time, and the 75th and 95th percentiles do
not change. The percentiles of wait time parallel the observed changes on average
wait time. The percentiles not only confirm the findings from the comparison of
averages, but they also magnify some of the differences across room allocation
combinations. This is all the more important, since some of the differences in
averages are relatively small. Total overtime decreases 13%, from 788.5 to 685.4
minutes. Lastly, we find that the average number of rooms experiencing overtime
is not very sensitive to the room allocation combination, as it consistently varies
between 10 and 13 rooms. In summary, high partial flexibility – with (in this
case) three rooms dedicated to emergencies—can perform better than complete
flexibility.
       Necessarily, there is a point where we can no longer dedicate an additional
room to emergencies without hurting the electives, who would not have access to
enough capacity to be handled in a timely fashion. In the base case, the expected
workload from the 75 scheduled elective surgeries requires that at least 15 operating
rooms are available during the 8-hour operating shift to keep expected utilization of

832              Partially Flexible Operating Rooms For Elective and Emergency Surgeries


these rooms below 100% (75 * 93 minutes/480 minutes per room = 14.5 rooms).
Hence, this is a transition point for elective wait time, as any allocation of rooms
to electives that results in fewer than 15 rooms (nF + nEL < 15) will lead to a
sharp increase in elective wait time and overtime (see, for example (6/14/0) and
(7/13/0)). Meanwhile, average room utilization decreases because the utilization
of the rooms dedicated to emergencies decreases as more rooms are dedicated
to them. Accounting for this capacity level is crucial, as it provides an upper
bound on how many rooms can be dedicated to emergencies. Besides this capacity
consideration, the size of the batch arrivals of electives is also important: with
electives arriving 15 at a time, having (nF + nEL < 15) will lead to an increase
in elective wait time, as some patients will have to wait upon arrival. However,
Ferrand et al. (2010) found that these transition points for electives depend more
on the capacity level than on the size of the batch arrivals of electives, since the
batch size had a small effect on performance measures, relative to the number of
dedicated rooms.
       Once five operating rooms have been dedicated to emergencies, dedicating
rooms to electives does not significantly reduce elective wait time averages and
percentiles, or total overtime, as shown by various combinations in Table 2, ex-
cept when at most one room is flexible (see combinations (5/14/1) to (5/0/15),
compared to (5/15/0)). However, combinations (5/1/14) and (5/0/15) provide
relatively small reductions in elective wait time and overtime, compared to the
increase in emergency wait time. This suggests that once we dedicate enough
capacity to emergencies, it is best to make the remaining capacity flexible.


Achieving Low Partial Flexibility by Making Operating Rooms Flexible
In a similar fashion to the previous section, we compare the effect of making rooms
flexible when taking them from the pool of rooms dedicated to emergencies and
from the pool of rooms dedicated to electives. Departing from the complete focus
policy (5/0/15), we observe that it is beneficial for system performance to add
flexible rooms by taking the rooms from those dedicated to electives. When we
incrementally make one of these dedicated rooms flexible, it results in lower aver-
age emergency wait time, as well as lower 75th and 95th percentile of emergency
wait time, while elective wait time is only minimally increased. Comparing low
partial flexibility with three flexible rooms (5/3/12) to the complete focus policy
illustrates this point: average emergency wait time is reduced 71%, from 4.8 to 1.4
minutes, the 95 percentile is reduced 59%, from 22.0 to 9.0 minutes, while average
elective wait time increases 9%, from 19.8 to 21.6 minutes, and the 95 percentile
wait time increases 11%, from 85.8 to 95.4 minutes. Meanwhile, total overtime is
not significantly changed.
       On the contrary, taking rooms from those dedicated to emergencies (e.g.,
(4/1/15)) deteriorates emergency wait time and does not improve elective wait
time, compared to the complete focus policy. As such, policies with even fewer
rooms available to emergencies (where nEM + nF ≤ 4, e.g., (4/0/16), (3/1/16))
would deteriorate emergency wait time further. This is illustrated with the output
from combination (4/0/16), which results in a three-fold increase in average
emergency wait time relative to the combination (5/0/15). The consideration of

capacity relative to the expected workload from emergencies is essential, as it gives
a lower bound on the number of rooms emergencies need access to. In this case,
the expected workload from the 12 emergencies requires that at least four rooms
are available for emergencies (12 * 125 minutes /480 minutes per room = 3.1
rooms), so given the need for responsiveness, we can expect that dedicating less
than five rooms to emergencies will result in higher emergency wait time.

Comparing High and Low Partial Flexibility
The graph in Figure 2 depicts average elective and emergency patient wait times
as we move away from the complete flexibility policy (0/20/0) toward high par-
tial flexibility (4/16/0), and from the complete focus policy (5/0/15) toward low
partial flexibility (5/4/11). It indicates the benefits of moving toward partial flex-
ibility and also allows us to compare the two types of partial flexibilities. This
comparison reveals that high partial flexibility (4/16/0) is overall better than low
partial flexibility (5/4/11): average emergency wait time is lower with high partial
flexibility while average elective wait time is not significantly different. Comparing
the 75th and 95th percentile values of the two partial flexibility policies leads to
the same observation and magnifies the difference for emergencies. Meanwhile,
total overtime is not significantly different. This comparison of the two ways to
achieve partial flexibility indicates that having mostly flexible rooms and a few
dedicated rooms to emergencies provides better system performance than having
most rooms dedicated and a few flexible rooms. Furthermore, by design, high par-
tial flexibility leads to more rooms being disrupted by emergencies than low partial

flexibility. This has two implications for electives: more electives are exposed to
emergency disruptions, and the electives in each room will experience fewer dis-
ruptions, given that the expected number and workload of emergencies is shared
among more rooms. These two implications have opposite effects on elective wait
time, and the above comparison of results shows that the net effect is insignificant.

Nonstationary Emergency Arrivals and Elective Cancellations
The average wait time resulting from the various room configurations under non-
stationary emergency arrivals (Case 2), and under elective cancellations (Case 3)
are displayed in Table 3 below. In our experiment, high and low partial flexibilities
provide similar types of improvements under nonstationary emergency arrivals,
when compared to the improvements obtained in the base case. Specifically, the
comparison of high partial flexibility (3/17/0) to complete flexibility (0/20/0)
indicates a reduction in elective emergency wait time without significant change
in emergency wait time, and the comparisons of low partial flexibility (5/3/12)
to complete dedication (5/0/15) shows a reduction in emergency wait time with
only a slight increase in elective patient wait time. The magnitude of the changes
is similar whether or not the arrival process of emergencies is stationary. Hence,
the key difficulty with emergencies is not that their arrival process is nonstation-
ary. Rather, it is the randomness of the arrival process, compounded by the long
procedure time duration.
      Cancellations have an effect on effective capacity, so we can anticipate the
direction of change in wait time relative to the cancellation rate. For example,
the inclusion of cancellations compared to the base case indicates a reduction in
average wait time in the anticipated ways: for emergencies, the average wait drops
close to zero when most rooms are flexible, and the change is insignificant when
most rooms are dedicated; for electives, the average wait time is reduced between
25% and 40%, depending on the room allocation. More importantly, the results in
Table 3 show that when elective cancellations are factored in, the comparisons of
high partial flexibility (3/17/0) to complete flexibility (0/20/0) and of low partial
flexibility (5/3/12) to complete dedication (5/0/15) indicate similar benefits of
partial flexibility as in the base case.

Increase in the Number of Emergency Patients Arrivals
We also investigate whether the benefits of partial flexibility are robust to changes
in the emergency stationary arrival rate and in the procedure time characteristics
of elective surgeries. The results of these sensitivity analyses are reported in Table
4 below.
      First, we increase the number of emergency patient arrivals (Case 4). As
we shift from complete flexibility to high partial flexibility, elective wait time de-
creases, while emergency wait time remains unchanged, as in the base case, and for
the same reason: the rooms dedicated to emergencies lead to fewer disruptions of
electives. The magnitude of the improvement is approximately the same as in the
base case. Shifting from the completely focused policy to low partial flexibility also
provides the same type of result as in the base case, and for the same reasons: emer-
gency wait time decreases, while that of electives increases, because emergencies

have access to more operating rooms, and some electives share flexible rooms with
emergencies. Compared to the base case, the magnitude of the improvement for
emergencies is similar (−77% for average wait time, from 22.1 to 5.2 minutes),
however, the deterioration for electives is greater than in the base case (+42% for
average wait time, from 19.8 to 28.2 minutes).
      We then test the effect of this increased emergency load in combination with
the nonstationary emergency arrival pattern used for Case 2. This is Case 5 in
Table 4. We observe similar patterns and similar performance measures as in Case
4, so we can draw the same conclusions as in the previous paragraph, reinforcing
the attractiveness of partial flexibility policies.

838               Partially Flexible Operating Rooms For Elective and Emergency Surgeries


Change in Elective Patient Procedure Time Mean and/or Variance
When the mean and variance of elective procedure time increase (Case 6), intu-
itively, aside from utilization which increases, the other performance measures
deteriorate. More importantly, we find that in this case shifting from a policy of
complete flexibility to high partial flexibility does not provide a Pareto improve-
ment. Rather, we observe a trade-off: dedicating rooms to emergencies reduces
their wait time at the expense of an increase in elective patient wait time (cf. Table
4). The reasons for this difference between the results in the base case and in
Case 6 are as follows. Regarding electives, in the base case, the expected aggre-
gate room utilization generated by the workload from electives alone is 73% (75
electives with expected duration of 93 minutes, given 20 operating rooms avail-
able for 480 minutes). When we increase the mean procedure time of electives
to 139 minutes, the total expected workload from elective surgeries exceeds the
total capacity available during the 8-hour shift. Therefore, contrary to the previous
cases, the electives now suffer more from the lack of capacity than they suffer from
emergency disruptions. Regarding emergencies, their wait time increases as a re-
sult of the reduced frequency of elective surgery completion due to the increased
elective procedure time. Under this increased emergency wait time, emergencies
now benefit from having rooms dedicated to them. Also, when shifting from com-
plete flexibility to high partial flexibility (3/17/0), the relative improvement for
emergencies is greater than the deterioration for electives, for whom only average
and 75th percentile of wait time increase. Meanwhile, shifting from a policy of
complete focus (5/0/15) to low partial flexibility (5/3/12) has the same benefit as
before, and for the same reason: it reduces the average wait time of emergencies,
while only slightly increasing that of electives, because emergencies will only use
the flexible rooms sporadically, thus only slightly affect electives negatively.
       When only the variance of the elective procedure time increases (Case 7),
average emergency wait time tends to decrease, when compared to the base case
(Table 2), for the combinations with high partial flexibility (3/17/0) and complete
flexibility (0/20/0). This would seem to be counterintuitive, because typically
an increase in procedure time variance leads to an increase in average wait time
(Hopp & Spearman, 2007). The reason for this result is that the long right-hand
tail of the lognormal distribution leads to a greater increase in the number of
short cases relative to the increase in long cases when the variance increases.
This is compounded by the fact that emergencies can access any flexible room
that becomes available. From this reasoning, we can expect that emergency wait
time will decrease as the variance of procedure time further increases, because
the frequency of this phenomenon will increase. This decrease does not happen
for the combinations with low partial flexibility because emergencies only rarely
use the flexible rooms and thus are not affected as much by changes to elective
surgeries. Similarly, emergency wait time remains unchanged under the complete
focus policy. Meanwhile, elective patient wait time increases, as expected.
       When the mean and variance of elective procedure time decrease (Case 8),
we find that shifting from complete flexibility and shifting from complete focus
provide the same results as in the base case. This sensitivity analysis provides
evidence that the base case results are robust to a decrease in elective procedure

time. With high partial flexibility (3/17/0), we notice that emergency wait time
is lower than in the base case, which is expected since emergencies can access a
flexible room faster when elective surgeries are shorter.

Observations on the Benefits of Partial Flexibility
Based on our investigations, we formulate and comment on two observations that
highlight how to achieve the benefits of partial flexibility. First, we define safety
capacity as the total operating room time available, excluding overtime, minus the
total expected operating time from the scheduled elective cases. We then have the
following observations.

OBSERVATION 1: (High partial flexibility): If originally all operating rooms are
flexible and there is sufficient safety capacity, then dedicating rooms to emergencies
will improve the performance of the system; it will reduce the wait time of electives
and will not increase the wait time of emergencies.

      This observation is counter-intuitive as we may expect that dedicating rooms
to emergencies would benefit emergencies at the expense of electives, yet the op-
posite result occurs. The reasons are as follows. For emergencies, having dedicated
rooms does not provide much improvement because emergencies have higher pri-
ority in accessing flexible rooms not dedicated to them. At the same time, by
dedicating rooms to emergencies, electives benefit more from the reduction of
emergency disruptions than they suffer from the capacity reduction. Also, one may
presume that emergency disruptions impede electives less than capacity reduction,
since electives have access to less capacity all of the time with capacity reduction,
while emergency disruptions imply a reduction in capacity for electives only on
an as needed basis. However, since electives wait for surgery in individual queues,
emergency arrivals become extremely disruptive for the electives waiting for the
particular operating room where the disruption occurs. It is also counter-intuitive
that dedicating rooms to electives does not improve the performance of the system.
The reason is that electives wait time is decreased only if we dedicate a large num-
ber of rooms to them, which would not be viable because it would significantly
increase the wait time of emergencies.
      This reasoning has a caveat in that it only applies if there is sufficient safety
capacity, so that at least one room could be dedicated to emergencies and the
remaining rooms would still have safety capacity. This is indicated by the sensitivity
analysis corresponding to an increase in elective patient procedure time mean and
variance (Case 6). The first implication is that if there is not enough safety capacity
to dedicate at least a room, then rooms should not be dedicated to emergencies
as the reduction in capacity is more detrimental to electives than are disruptions
from emergencies in this case. The second implication is that the number of rooms
we can dedicate to emergencies is limited and is a function of how much safety
capacity is available. This, by definition, depends on the number of rooms and
the total expected workload of scheduled electives. In practice, the condition of
sufficient safety capacity is not a strong limitation because it is unlikely that a
hospital would decide to schedule more workload than it can accommodate with
its capacity. More importantly, when there is safety capacity, dedicating even one

                                                                                             15405915, 2014, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/deci.12096 by University Of Exeter, Wiley Online Library on [25/02/2025].

or two rooms to emergencies will improve the performance of the system, as long
as emergencies can also access the rooms used for elective surgeries.
      To summarize the trade-off between the capacity effect and the disruption
effect, we can state that if utilization is high (i.e., low safety capacity), then the ca-
pacity effect is greater than the disruption effect on the performance of the system,
and vice versa when utilization is low (i.e., high safety capacity). Characterizing
“low” or ‘high” would need to be determined by model experimentation or trial
and error.
OBSERVATION 2: (Low partial flexibility): If originally all operating rooms are
focused, then increasing flexibility will improve the performance of the system if
the flexible rooms are taken from the set of rooms dedicated to electives; it will
reduce the wait time of emergencies, while only slightly increasing the wait time
of electives.
      The flexible rooms clearly benefit emergencies, who now have access to more
capacity than under the focused policy. This applies to the base case conditions
as well as to the sensitivity analysis cases. Electives are only slightly negatively
affected by this change because the presence of rooms dedicated to emergencies
acts as a buffer against emergency disruptions, which implies that only a few
emergency surgeries will be performed in the flexible rooms when all dedicated
rooms are busy. As a result, if we dedicate an appropriate number of rooms to
emergencies in the first place, making a few rooms flexible should leave electives
almost unaffected, everything else being equal. The two observations and the effect
of partial flexibility on elective and emergency wait time can be summarized in
Figure 3 below.

CONCLUSIONS
With limited operating room capacity, the necessary handling of emergency
surgeries with highest priority poses a recurrent challenge for hospital administra-
tors striving to efficiently and effectively provide surgeries to scheduled elective
patients. We survey several literature domains to identify the different ways that
have been proposed to address this challenge, and subsequently investigate the
potential benefits of partial flexibility using a stylized simulation model based on
hospital data.
      Our evaluation of partial flexibility indicates that it provides improvements on
patient wait time and staff overtime over both completely flexible and completely
focused policies. Given our findings, we formulate two observations that provide
guidance to hospitals on how to implement partial flexibility: (i) high partial
flexibility—when dedicating a few operating rooms, the rooms should be dedicated
to emergencies, which will reduce the wait time of electives without increasing
the wait time of emergencies; (ii) low partial flexibility—when making a few
operating rooms flexible, the rooms made flexible should be taken from the set of
rooms dedicated to electives, which will reduce the wait time of emergencies more
than it will increase the wait time of electives. Overtime will be reduced with high
partial flexibility and remain unchanged with low partial flexibility. By employing
either form of partial flexibility, hospital managers can better handle the trade-off
between responsiveness and efficiency. Determining the appropriate number of
dedicated and flexible rooms can then be guided by considerating operating room
capacity in relation to the expected workload from electives and emergencies, as
these workload to capacity ratios give bounds on the minimum number of rooms
emergencies and electives need access to, as well as the maximum number of
rooms that can be dedicated to emergencies. As a starting point to set up high
partial flexibility, hospital managers could dedicate to emergencies the number
of rooms that corresponds to the available safety capacity, and then reduce this
number if elective wait time and/or staff overtime is still too high. To set up low
partial flexibility, hospital managers could start with making flexible one room that
was dedicated to electives, then incrementally make additional rooms flexible if
emergency wait time is still too high.
      Our results suggest that the benefits of partial flexibility can be attained
by more than one room allocation combination, and different combinations cor-
respond to a different degree of capacity reduction and schedule disruption by
emergencies. With partial flexibility, as one approaches complete dedication, the
capacity reduction effects can be more significantly detrimental than the disrup-
tions, while as one approaches complete flexibility the opposite is true. In addition,
comparing the two forms of partial flexibility indicates that high partial flexibility
tends to perform better than low partial flexibility: in general it provides much
lower emergency wait time with only minor increases in elective wait time, total
overtime, and room utilization. Hence, the use of low partial flexibility would need
to be justified by lower operating cost or easier implementation and management.
Otherwise, we recommend implementing high partial flexibility.
      Furthermore, we find that the two observations on the benefits of partial
flexibility hold whether the arrival rate of emergencies is stationary or not, and
whether there are elective surgery cancellations or not. They are also robust to

                                                                                            15405915, 2014, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/deci.12096 by University Of Exeter, Wiley Online Library on [25/02/2025].

an increase in emergency arrivals, to a decrease in elective patient procedure
time mean and variance, and the second observation holds when elective patient
procedure time mean and variance increases. We did not test the effect of shorter
or longer emergency procedures, because in practice hospitals do not have control
over the type of emergency surgeries coming in, whereas they can affect the mix of
long and short elective procedures through the scheduling decisions. Yet, we can
expect that the longer and the more variable emergency surgeries are, the greater
the negative effect these surgeries will have on electives when the operating rooms
are shared, reinforcing the appeal of a partial flexibility policy.
      Finally, in the light of the previous research that has considered partial
flexibility, we concur that partial flexibility provides benefits. However, we point
out an important distinction. When demand prioritization is not factored in, the
main idea in the past literature is that partial flexibility can approach the results
obtained with complete flexibility, but at a much lower cost (e.g., Jordan and
Graves 1995). In our case, where patient prioritization is a key aspect, partial
flexibility can provide better overall performance than complete flexibility. This
result concurs with the finding from Ata and Van Mieghem (2009) who considered
demand prioritization and found that when the system was serving a majority
of low priority demand, as in our case, a combination of flexible and dedicated
resources provided better responsiveness than did dedicated resources only.
      We used our simulation model to generate a broad understanding of what
type of room allocation combinations better handle the trade-off between respon-
siveness and efficiency, but this is not without limitations. In practice, it may be
the case that switching between elective and emergency surgeries requires addi-
tional turnaround time, because of the increasing use of specialized equipment
with complex setup. Our study is limited to the cases when this extra turnover time
does not occur, and considering its effect would be an interesting future research
topic because such extra setup time would make low partial flexibility a more ap-
pealing policy. Another limitation is that the lognormal distribution can have many
cases close to zero, which may not be realistic. This limitation could be overcome
with truncated lognormal distributions or by changing the location parameter. Ac-
counting for the cost and the organizational implications for team cohesiveness
of operating flexible or dedicated operating rooms would also be important future
research. Studying the interactions between elective scheduling decisions and the
assignment of specific surgery cases to each operating room is another interesting
open research question, since the schedule of electives can affect emergency wait
time. Specifically, we assumed no real time reassignment of electives to rooms
to adapt to variable processing times, arrival times, and emergency disruptions.
Developing dynamic prioritization schemes between emergencies and electives
to account for the status of the system in real time could improve performance
further. Research on analytical results with approximate flexibility measures could
also guide resource allocation decisions in hospitals.
