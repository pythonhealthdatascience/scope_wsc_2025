Many Asian countries' healthcare systems have a mixed-type registration, accepting both walk-in patients and scheduled patients. This complex registration system causes a long patient waiting time in outpatient clinics. Different approaches have been proposed to reduce the waiting time. This study uses the integration of discrete event simulation (DES) and agent-based simulation (ABS) to improve patient waiting time and is the first attempt to apply this approach to solve this key problem faced by orthopedic departments. From the data collected, patient behaviors are modeled and incorporated into a massive agent-based simulation. The proposed approach is an aid for analyzing and modifying orthopedic department processes, allows us to consider far more details, and provides more reliable results. After applying the proposed approach, the total waiting time of the orthopedic department fell from 1246.39 minutes to 847.21 minutes. Thus, using the correct simulation model significantly reduces patient waiting time in an orthopedic department.",1,,,,,"Kittipittayakorn, Cholada/JRX-3137-2023","Ying, Kuo-Ching/0000-0002-9549-5290",,,,,,,,,,,,,2040-2295,2040-2309,,,,,2016,2016,,,,,,,,4189206,10.1155/2016/4189206,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4189206,,,,,,,,27195606,,,,,WOS:000372629200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Specifically we investigate the effect of resource flexibility on patient waiting time and throughput in an orthopedic care process. We further seek to explore on how implementation of resource flexibility on patient treatment processes affects patient access to healthcare services. We focus on two resources, namely, orthopedic surgeon and operating room. Methods: The observational approach was used to collect process data. The developed model was validated by comparing the simulation output with actual patient data collected from the studied orthopedic care process. We developed different scenarios to identify the best resource flexibility scenario and explore the effect of resource flexibility on patient waiting time, throughput, and future changes in demand. The developed scenarios focused on creating flexibility on service capacity of this care process by altering the amount of additional human resource capacity at different stages of patient care process and extending the use of operating room capacity. Results: The study found that resource flexibility can improve responsiveness to patient demand in the treatment process. Testing different scenarios showed that the introduction of resource flexibility reduces patient waiting time and improves throughput. The simulation results show that patient access to health services can be improved by implementing resource flexibility at different stages of the patient treatment process. Conclusion: This study contributes to the current health care literature by explaining how implementing resource flexibility at different stages of patient care processes can improve ability to respond to increasing patients demands.

Each surgery may have a random duration, which results in room idle time and patient waiting time. One of the major factors affecting the idle and waiting times is the schedule of surgeries in the OR. To better sequence multiple surgeries to reduce idle and waiting time, an effective performance evaluation method is needed. Although discrete event simulation can be used to evaluate the performance of surgery schedules, the long simulation time makes scheduling optimization more computationally intensive. In this paper, an analytical model to evaluate the performance of OR schedules in orthopedic surgery department is introduced. First, closed formulas to evaluate the case of two surgeries are developed and used as a building block in subsequent studies. Then, an iteration procedure is presented by aggregating every two surgeries into one using the two-surgery formula, and continuing to approach the next one, until all surgeries are aggregated into one. Using such a model, the expected idle time and waiting time for a given surgery schedule can be calculated quickly and accurately. Such a work provides an efficient performance evaluation tool that can be used for optimization of OR schedules and investigation of the impacts of different schedules.",0,,,,,"zeng, zexian/AAK-4651-2021; Li, Jingshan/L-4667-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1936-6582,1936-6590,,,,JUN,2018,30,01-Feb,,,SI,,198,223,,10.1007/s10696-016-9253-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10696-016-9253-7,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000432793500010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Given the long waiting times to have a knee arthroplasty, some governments have proposed prioritization systems for patients on waiting lists based on their level of need. Questions/Purposes We therefore estimated the needs and demand of knee arthroplasty in four regions of Spain during a 5-year period. Methods We developed a discrete event simulation model to reproduce the process of knee arthroplasty. The prioritization system was compared with the usual waiting list management strategy (by waiting time only). Results Under the prioritization system, patients saved an average of 4.5 months (95% confidence interval, 4.4-4.6 months) adjusted by level of need. The proportion of patients who experienced excessive waiting times was small and was associated with low levels of priority. The 5-year projection of the volume of unmet needs for knee arthroplasty remained stable; however, although the volume of need for the first knee arthroplasty decreased by 12%, the volume of need for an arthroplasty in the contralateral knee increased by 50%. Conclusions The data suggested the prioritization system was more beneficial than assigning surgery by waiting time only.

Variations in demand and supply cause fluctuating waiting lists, and it is challenging to level the activities between the clinic's two units, the outpatient clinic and the operating theater, to obtain short waiting times for all activities. Based on these challenges, we describe and present a planning problem referred to as the Long-term Master Scheduling Problem (LMSP), where the objective is to construct an integrated Long-term Master Schedule (LMS) that facilitates short waiting times in both units. The LMS can be separated into two schedules, one cyclic high-level schedule, and one non-cyclic low-level schedule. The demand for outpatient clinic consultations and surgeries is stochastic, as are the waiting lists. To account for this, we propose a planning framework consisting of an optimization model to solve the LMSP, and a two-level planning procedure. In the planning procedure, we first solve the LMSP to construct the LMS for the upcoming planning horizon. Then, to adjust to the fluctuating waiting lists, we periodically refine the low-level schedule by solving a constrained LMSP. We also develop a simulation-based evaluation procedure to evaluate the planning framework in a real-life setting and use this to investigate different planning strategies. We find that imposing flexible, dynamic and agile planning strategies improve waiting time outcomes and patient throughput. Furthermore, combining the strategies yields additive improvements.",1,,,,,"Andersson, Henrik/ABA-6471-2021","Andersson, Henrik/0000-0002-0312-8072",,,,,,,,,,,,,0377-2217,1872-6860,,,,Jan-16,2025,320,2,,,,,433,447,,10.1016/j.ejor.2024.08.021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2024.08.021,,Sep-24,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001325573000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this paper, the authors use discrete event simulation to explore the care process at an orthopedic department. Our main focus is improving utilization of surgeons while minimizing patient wait time. Methods: The authors collaborated with orthopedic department personnel to map the current operations of orthopedic care process in order to identify factors that influence poor surgeons utilization and high patient waiting time.

That is, improved surgeon utilization and reduced patient waiting time. Simulation results demonstrate that with improved surgeon utilizations, up to 55% increase of future demand can be accommodated without patients reaching current waiting time at this clinic, thus, improving patient access to health care services.

Commonly, these patients need to be seen again by a doctor or emergency nurse practitioner after an X-ray image has been taken in order to finalise the diagnosis and determine the next stage in the patients' pathway. Here, significant waiting times can accrue for these follow-up consultations after radiographic imaging although the vast majority of patients are discharged. Research evidence from pilot studies suggests that patients with minor appendicular injuries could be safely discharged by a suitably qualified radiographer directly after imaging thereby avoiding queues for repeated consultation. In this study, we model patient pathways through an emergency department (ED) at a hospital in the South West of England using process mapping, interviews with ED staff and discrete event simulation (DES). The DES model allowed us to compare the current practice at the hospital with scenarios using radiographer-led discharge of patients directly after imaging and assess the reduction in patients' length of stay in ED. We also quantified trade-offs between the provision of radiographer-led discharge and its effects, i.e. reduction in waiting times and ED workload.

Methods: We applied discrete-event simulation modelling. The model was populated with real world data from a university hospital with a strong focus on reducing waiting time to surgery for patients with hip fracture. The system modelled concerned two patient groups that share the same OR resources: hip-fracture and other non-elective orthopaedic patients in need of surgical treatment. We simulated three scenarios based on the literature and interaction with staff and managers: (1) baseline; (2) reduced turnover time between surgeries by 20 min and (3) one extra OR during the day, Monday to Friday. The outcome variables were waiting time to surgery and the percentage of patients who waited longer than 24 hours for surgery. Results: The mean waiting time in hours was significantly reduced from 16.2 hours in scenario 1 (baseline) to 13.3 hours in scenario 2 and 13.6 hours in scenario 3 for hip-fracture surgery and from 26.0 hours in baseline to 18.9 hours in scenario 2 and 18.5 hours in scenario 3 for other non-elective patients.

This has resulted in significant delays in service provision. In response, Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening Clinics and Multidisciplinary Services (OPSC) have been introduced to assess and co-ordinate care for semi-and non-urgent patients. Objectives To compare the efficiency of delivering increased semi-and non-urgent orthopaedic outpatient services through: (1) additional OPSC services; (2) additional traditional orthopaedic medical services with added surgical resources (TOMS + Surg); or (3) additional TOMS without added surgical resources (TOMS - Surg). Methods A cost-utility analysis using discrete event simulation (DES) with dynamic queuing (DQ) was used to predict the cost effectiveness, throughput, queuing times, and resource utilisation, associated with introducing additional OPSC or TOMS +/- Surg versus usual care. Results The introduction of additional OPSC or TOMS (+/- surgery) would be considered cost effective in Australia. However, OPSC was the most cost-effective option. Increasing the capacity of current OPSC services is an efficient way to improve patient throughput and waiting times without exceeding current surgical resources. An OPSC capacity increase of similar to 100 patients per month appears cost effective (A$8546 per quality-adjusted life-year) and results in a high level of OPSC utilisation (98 %). Conclusion Increasing OPSC capacity to manage semi- and non-urgent patients would be cost effective, improve throughput, and reduce waiting times without exceeding current surgical resources.

Earthquake-related patients often have trauma injuries and stress-linked (ischemic) ailments that require multiple healthcare procedures, such as minor orthopedic treatment, surgical treatment of fractures, and thrombolysis or thrombectomy. Hospital operation models have been proposed to examine these healthcare procedures; however, they exhibit two fundamental gaps that hinder their ability to assess critical service areas after earthquakes. First, these models rest heavily on emergency procedures based on injury severity rather than type. Second, healthcare demands are often modeled from injury profiles after moderate earthquakes in the United States without including epidemiology data after large earthquakes globally. This approach has led to oversimplified hospital emergency services and resource utilization representation. This research presents a new hospital operations model based on patient injury type and worldwide earthquake epidemiology to fill these gaps. We build the model using discrete-event simulations to capture dynamic metrics on hospital operational outcomes after the earthquake, such as patient time-to-treatment and unassisted patient ratio. We then studied how these metrics vary with different levels of functional capacity in the specific hospital resources. Our results showed that waiting times for emergency department (ED)-level patients vary non-linearly with changes in the number of functional service areas. Also, significant reduction in the waiting time for hospital-level procedures was found for relatively small decrease in the bed occupancy rate, for example, if reverse triage procedures are activated (i.e. a discharge of non-critical patients admitted before the earthquake). Our findings provide a valuable tool for decision-making in hospital preparedness as they explicitly measure the impacts of functional capacity on key healthcare metrics for specific earthquake-related patients.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8755-2930,1944-8201,,,,NOV,2024,40,4,,,,,2402,2429,,10.1177/87552930241262788,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/87552930241262788,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001344367100010,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, the developed simulation model provides estimates for a what-if situation related to the prognosis of an increasing number of hip-joint replacements.",1,,,,,"Persson, Jan/C-1737-2013","Persson, Jan A/0000-0002-9471-8405",,,,,,,,,,,,,1386-9620,1572-9389,,,,JUN,2010,13,2,,,,,182,191,,10.1007/s10729-009-9122-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10729-009-9122-y,,,,,,,,20629419,,,,,WOS:000281585300007,View Full Record in Web of Science

A detailed description of the system and the main pathways followed by patients during their care process are provided. In fact, analyzing the patient flow has served to improve healthcare delivery in this clinic by identifying the sources of delay which are mainly related to inefficient human resources management. Therefore, a list of improvement scenarios is proposed and evaluated using discrete event simulation model. The proposed changes have resulted in a great improvement in terms of minimizing the patient waiting time (WT) and total length of stay (LOS). Furthermore, we proposed a multiple linear regression model that helped us to analyze the relationship between the performance-related factors (WT and LOS) and the influencing variables related to patient flows. Indeed, these models enable managers to plan reorganization of this outpatient clinical and adopt the suitable strategies for each type of pathway.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2047-9700,2047-9719,,,,Oct-02,2021,14,4,,,,,1492,1500,,10.1080/20479700.2020.1788335,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20479700.2020.1788335,,Jul-20,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000548001200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In Tunisia, especially in Habib Bourguiba Hospital in Sfax, Open scheduling policy is considered to schedule elective surgeries. In the orthopedic service, operating room scheduling is carried out weekly. Three operating rooms are available and one of them is assigned to a special kind of surgeries called septic. At the tactical level, elective operations are assigned to weeks so that the workload (average) by week is approximately equal to the weekly capacity. In the selection of surgeries the variation of surgery duration is not taken into account. The average of the operations durations are considered for planning and scheduling. This situation can lead to either an overtime which is unwelcome by surgeons and surgical team. Or an underutilization of OR resources which generate an additional cost for hospital. To deal with this problem, we propose two stochastic MILP models that take into account the stochastic aspect of the surgery duration. Once the set of operations to be carried out in a week are selected, we choose at the operational level to which day and which room the operations are assigned and in which order. As patients are asked to come to the hospital in the morning, the best scheduling is the one that minimizes the patients waiting time. In this paper, we provide two MILP to model this problem. In the first one an additive slack is given to the total duration of surgery to deal with any possible overtime. The other one try to equilibrate the total charge between room/day and the total surgery variations during the week. The two models are solved using Cplex and then a simulation model is used to evaluate the robustness of the provided solutions.",0,,,,,"Jerbi, Badreddine/S-5504-2019","Jerbi, Badreddine/0000-0002-7299-8143",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-1-4799-6773-5,,,,2014,,,,,,,257,262,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000358866300046,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to determine the micro cost differences of the Glasgow non-operative trauma virtual pathway in comparison to a traditional pathway. Design Discrete event simulation was used to model and analyse cost and resource utilisation with an activity-based costing approach. Data for a full comparison before the process change was unavailable so we used a modelling approach, comparing a virtual fracture clinic (VFC) with a simulated traditional fracture clinic (TFC). Setting The orthopaedic unit VFC pathway pioneered at Glasgow Royal Infirmary has attracted significant attention and interest and is the focus of this cost study. Outcome measures Our study focused exclusively on patients with non-operative trauma attending emergency department or the minor injuries unit and the subsequent step in the patient pathway. Retrospective studies of patient outcomes as a result of the protocol introductions for specific injuries are presented in association with activity costs from the models. Results Patients are satisfied with the new pathway, the information provided and the outcome of their injuries (Evidence Level IV). There was a 65% reduction in the number of first outpatient face-to-face (f2f) attendances in orthopaedics. In the VFC pathway, the resources required per day were significantly lower for all staff groups (p <= 0.001). The overall cost per patient of the VFC pathway was 22.84 pound (95% CI 21.74 to 23.92) per patient compared with 36.81 pound (95% CI 35.65 to 37.97) for the TFC pathway. Conclusions Our results give a clearer picture of the cost comparison of the virtual pathway over a wholly traditional f2f clinic system. The use of simulation-based stochastic costings in healthcare economic analysis has been limited to date, but this study provides evidence for adoption of this method as a basis for its application in other healthcare settings.",1,,,,,"mcdonald, david/H-7813-2013; Van der Meer, Robert B./O-1731-2016","McDonald, David/0000-0002-9805-7720; Van der Meer, Robert B./0000-0002-9442-1628; Morton, Alec/0000-0003-3803-8517; Anderson, Gillian Hopkins/0000-0002-5768-6360",,,,,,,,,,,,,2044-6055,,,,,SEP,2017,7,9,,,,,,,e014509,10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014509,,,,,,,,28882905,,,,,WOS:000412650700018,View Full Record in Web of Science

It has shown efficiency benefits as it allows parallel processing of patients in a dedicated block room (BR). However, granular quantification of these benefits to hospital operations is lacking. The goal of this study was to determine the financial effect of establishing a BR using comprehensive operational modeling. Methods: A discrete-event simulation model of daily operating room (OR) patient flow for TJA procedures at a mid-sized hospital was developed. Two scenarios were tested: (1) without and (2) with a BR. Scenarios were compared according to staffing requirements, hours/day, and labor costs. The number of ORs and cases varied from 2 to 6 ORs performing 3 to 5 cases. These results were used as the inputs of a discounted cash flow (CF) model. Discounted CF model outputs were CF, net present value, internal rate of return, and return on investment. Results: Mean time savings of incorporating a BR were 68 min/d (range: 30 to 80 min/d), reducing the OR closing time by 1 hour. Incremental labor costs/day from nurse overtime pay ranged from $2,025 to $10,125 with no BR and $1,595 to $9,045 with a BR, which resulted in an increase in profit/day from $360 to $1,605. The CF/annum was $54,363, the net present value was $213,082, the internal rate of return was 12%, and the return on investment was 43.61%. Discussion: This study demonstrates that under all scenarios, a BR is more profitable than no BR to a hospital performing TJA via a bundled care or private payer remuneration model. A BR was shown to be financially net positive even when considering the necessary financial investment to establish it. In addition, this study demonstrates the potential of combining discrete-event simulation with financial analyses to assess various operational models of care to improve hospital efficiency, such as dedicated trauma rooms and swing rooms.",1,,,,,"Sarhangian, Vahid/S-8861-2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1067-151X,1940-5480,,,,Aug-01,2022,30,15,,,,,E1058,E1065,,10.5435/JAAOS-D-21-01217,http://dx.doi.org/10.5435/JAAOS-D-21-01217,,,,,,,,35862214,,,,,WOS:000829109400013,View Full Record in Web of Science

The model used anonymised patient records between 2016 and 2019 of elective orthopaedic procedures from a National Health Service (NHS) Trust in England. In this paper, it is used to investigate scenarios including resourcing (beds and theatres) and productivity (lengths of stay, delayed discharges and theatre activity) to support planning for meeting new NHS targets aimed at reducing elective orthopaedic surgical backlogs in a proposed ring-fenced orthopaedic surgical facility. The simulation is interactive and intended for use by health service planners and clinicians.Results A higher number of beds (65-70) than the proposed number (40 beds) will be required if lengths of stay and delayed discharge rates remain unchanged. Reducing lengths of stay in line with national benchmarks reduces bed utilisation to an estimated 60%, allowing for additional theatre activity such as weekend working. Further, reducing the proportion of patients with a delayed discharge by 75% reduces bed utilisation to below 40%, even with weekend working. A range of other scenarios can also be investigated directly by NHS planners using the interactive web app.Conclusions The simulation model is intended to support capacity planning of orthopaedic elective services by identifying a balance of capacity across theatres and beds and predicting the impact of productivity measures on capacity requirements.

We constructed a DES model for thoracic, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic surgeries summarized from a tertiary Chinese hospital. The model covers preoperative preparations, OR occupation, and OR preparation. Parameters were sourced from patient data and staff experience. Model outcome is OR throughput. Post-validation, scenario analyses were conducted for each department, including: (1) improving preoperative patient preparation time; (2) increasing PACU beds; (3) improving OR preparation time; (4) use of new equipment to reduce the operative time of a selected surgery type; three levels of improvement (slight, moderate, large) were investigated.ResultsThe first three improvement scenarios resulted in a 1%-5% increase in OR throughput across the three departments. Large reductions in operative time of the selected surgery types led to approximately 12%, 33%, and 38% increases in gastrointestinal, thoracic, and orthopedic surgery throughput, respectively. Moderate reductions resulted in 6%-17% increases in throughput and slight reductions of 1%-7%.ConclusionsThe model could reliably reflect OR workflows of the three departments.
