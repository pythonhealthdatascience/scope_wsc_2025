Variations in demand and supply cause fluctuating waiting lists, and it is challenging to level the activities between the clinic's two units, the outpatient clinic and the operating theater, to obtain short waiting times for all activities. Based on these challenges, we describe and present a planning problem referred to as the Long-term Master Scheduling Problem (LMSP), where the objective is to construct an integrated Long-term Master Schedule (LMS) that facilitates short waiting times in both units. The LMS can be separated into two schedules, one cyclic high-level schedule, and one non-cyclic low-level schedule. The demand for outpatient clinic consultations and surgeries is stochastic, as are the waiting lists. To account for this, we propose a planning framework consisting of an optimization model to solve the LMSP, and a two-level planning procedure. In the planning procedure, we first solve the LMSP to construct the LMS for the upcoming planning horizon. Then, to adjust to the fluctuating waiting lists, we periodically refine the low-level schedule by solving a constrained LMSP. We also develop a simulation-based evaluation procedure to evaluate the planning framework in a real-life setting and use this to investigate different planning strategies. We find that imposing flexible, dynamic and agile planning strategies improve waiting time outcomes and patient throughput. Furthermore, combining the strategies yields additive improvements. © 2024 The Author(s)",1,Integer programming; Integrated resource planning; OR in health services; Simulation; Surgery scheduling,Integer programming; Orthopedics; Resource allocation; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Transplantation (surgical); Integer Program- ming; Integrated resources planning; OR in health services; Outpatient clinic; Planning framework; Scheduling problem; Simulation; Surgery scheduling; Waiting lists; Waiting time; Stochastic systems,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202176299

In Tunisia, especially in Habib Bourguiba Hospital in Sfax, Open scheduling policy is considered to schedule elective surgeries. In the orthopedic service, operating room scheduling is carried out weekly. Three operating rooms are available and one of them is assigned to a special kind of surgeries called septic. At the tactical level, elective operations are assigned to weeks so that the workload (average) by week is approximately equal to the weekly capacity. In the selection of surgeries the variation of surgery duration is not taken into account. The average of the operations durations are considered for planning and scheduling. This situation can lead to either an overtime which is unwelcome by surgeons and surgical team. Or an underutilization of OR resources which generate an additional cost for hospital. To deal with this problem, we propose two stochastic MILP models that take into account the stochastic aspect of the surgery duration. Once the set of operations to be carried out in a week are selected, we choose at the operational level to which day and which room the operations are assigned and in which order. As patients are asked to come to the hospital in the morning, the best scheduling is the one that minimizes the patients waiting time. In this paper, we provide two MILP to model this problem. In the first one an additive slack is given to the total duration of surgery to deal with any possible overtime. The other one try to equilibrate the total charge between room/day and the total surgery variations during the week. The two models are solved using Cplex and then a simulation model is used to evaluate the robustness of the provided solutions. © 2014 IEEE.",0,MILP; Operating room; Simulation; Stochastic; Surgical schedule,Integer programming; Operating rooms; Scheduling; Stochastic systems; Surgery; Elective surgeries; MILP; Planning and scheduling; Scheduling policies; Simulation; Simulation approach; Stochastic; Stochastic durations; Stochastic models,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921329184

This paper presents a discrete event simulation model of an orthopedic treatment pathway in Australia from the point of referral to surgical intervention for knee pain patients. The simulation model was used to investigate strategies for reducing the backlog of patients and average waiting time for initial orthopedic review, showing that a reduction of 34% in average waiting time can be achieved by adding three additional appointments per week. The model demonstrates that introduction of community-based rehabilitation early in the patient journey can significantly reduce waiting lists and improve patient recovery, without the need for surgical intervention. This simulation model has been designed to be reusable for other types of orthopedic conditions, and for use in other health services.  © 2022 IEEE.",1,,Patient rehabilitation; Surgery; Australia; Average waiting-time; Discrete-event simulation model; High demand; Knee pain; Performance targets; Simulation model; Surgical interventions; Time-based performance; Waiting lists; Discrete event simulation,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147434734

Improving utilization of existing workforce capacity can reduce the existing gap between surgical demand and available workforce capacity. In this paper, the authors use discrete event simulation to explore the care process at an orthopedic department. Our main focus is improving utilization of surgeons while minimizing patient wait time. Methods: The authors collaborated with orthopedic department personnel to map the current operations of orthopedic care process in order to identify factors that influence poor surgeons utilization and high patient waiting time. The authors used an observational approach to collect data. The developed model was validated by comparing the simulation output with the actual patient data that were collected from the studied orthopedic care process. The authors developed a proposal scenario to show how to improve surgeon utilization. Results: The simulation results showed that if ancillary services could be performed before the start of clinic examination services, the orthopedic care process could be highly improved. That is, improved surgeon utilization and reduced patient waiting time. Simulation results demonstrate that with improved surgeon utilizations, up to 55% increase of future demand can be accommodated without patients reaching current waiting time at this clinic, thus, improving patient access to health care services. Conclusion: This study shows how simulation modeling can be used to improve health care processes. This study was limited to a single care process; however the findings can be applied to improve other orthopedic care process with similar operational characteristics. © 2016 Simwita and Helgheim.",1,Health care process; Patient; Waiting time,adult; article; controlled study; human; orthopedics; patient coding; simulation; surgeon,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995630327

In order to respond to the growth in demand for ambulatory care service, there is a need for providing effective care while improving the efficiencies of health care operations. Efforts to increase efficiency in ambulatory care can include changes to day-to-day operations of an outpatient clinic such as exam room allocation policies, or one-time large scale changes such as outpatient clinic layout design. Additionally, efficiencies can be achieved by adjusting practices and decision making in multiple clinics at the same time, particularly accounting for the interdependencies that exist among multiple outpatient clinics within a health center. In this dissertation, we show that how increasing flexibility or resource sharing, and managing the clinic interdependencies can increase the efficiency of the clinics and correspondingly provide better timeliness of care. Particularly, in the first chapter, flexibility in exam room allocation policies in outpatient clinics are analyzed using a discrete-event simulation model. Rather than dedicating exam rooms to physicians, or pooling all rooms among all providers, we characterize the impact of alternate policies that partially share exam rooms among providers. Our findings show that it is not necessary to fully share rooms among providers in order to reduce patient LOS and physician idle time. Instead, most of the benefit of pooling can be achieved by implementation of a compromise room allocation approach, limiting the need for significant organizational changes within the clinic. In the second chapter, efficiency of patient care that is impacted by physical layout decisions is examined. Particularly, relationships between physical layout designs, flexible patient flows, and operational policies are analyzed through development of a simulation optimization framework. For this purpose, the outpatient clinic layout problem is modelled as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and solved with a meta-heuristic algorithm accounting for the size of the problem. Then a discrete-event simulation is used to evaluate the candidate layouts accounting for stochastic patient flows. Our findings show the importance of physical design on workflow for providers and flow of patients in the design of new ambulatory care clinics. In the third chapter, the impact of managing existing interdependencies among different health centers are characterized. Operation of the radiology department can potentially impact several other outpatient clinics such as rheumatology, orthopedics, primary care, and surgery. In order to manage such interdependencies, a simulation optimization framework is proposed. © IEOM Society International.",1,,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067074223

Being able to satisfy the demand with a limited outpatient service capacity is an important operational challenge. The objective of our research consists in studying the relationships and interactions between patient flows, resource capacity (number of consulting rooms and number of nurses) and appointment scheduling rules in order to improve an outpatient orthopaedic clinic performance. Discrete event simulation is used to model outpatient flows. An experimental design was developed to test how to assign consulting rooms and nurses to each orthopedist considering four appointment scheduling rules and three patient flow types of varied complexity. Analysis of variance and the Tukey test are used to evaluate the simulation results. Our conclusion is that in order to improve the outpatient orthopaedic clinic performance, resources (consulting rooms, nurses) and appointment scheduling rules must be adapted to the different patient flows. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the long waiting times to have a knee arthroplasty, some governments have proposed prioritization systems for patients on waiting lists based on their level of need. Questions/Purposes: We therefore estimated the needs and demand of knee arthroplasty in four regions of Spain during a 5-year period. Methods: We developed a discrete event simulation model to reproduce the process of knee arthroplasty. The prioritization system was compared with the usual waiting list management strategy (by waiting time only). Results: Under the prioritization system, patients saved an average of 4.5 months (95% confidence interval, 4.4-4.6 months) adjusted by level of need. The proportion of patients who experienced excessive waiting times was small and was associated with low levels of priority. The 5-year projection of the volume of unmet needs for knee arthroplasty remained stable; however, although the volume of need for the first knee arthroplasty decreased by 12%, the volume of need for an arthroplasty in the contralateral knee increased by 50%. Conclusions: The data suggested the prioritization system was more beneficial than assigning surgery by waiting time only. The 5-year projection of the volume of unmet needs for knee arthroplasty remained stable, despite the increase in the need for contralateral knee arthroplasty.

The proposed changes have resulted in a great improvement in terms of minimizing the patient waiting time (WT) and total length of stay (LOS).

First, closed formulas to evaluate the case of two surgeries are developed and used as a building block in subsequent studies. Then, an iteration procedure is presented by aggregating every two surgeries into one using the two-surgery formula, and continuing to approach the next one, until all surgeries are aggregated into one. Using such a model, the expected idle time and waiting time for a given surgery schedule can be calculated quickly and accurately. Such a work provides an efficient performance evaluation tool that can be used for optimization of OR schedules and investigation of the impacts of different schedules. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",0,Aggregation; Idle time; Operating room; Orthopedic surgery; Scheduling; Waiting time,Agglomeration; Discrete event simulation; Iterative methods; Operating rooms; Orthopedics; Scheduling; Effective performance; Idle time; Orthopedic surgery; Patient waiting time; Performance evaluation tools; Performance evaluations; Scheduling optimization; Waiting-time; Surgery,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984827801

This has resulted in significant delays in service provision. In response, Orthopaedic Physiotherapy Screening Clinics and Multidisciplinary Services (OPSC) have been introduced to assess and co-ordinate care for semi- and non-urgent patients. Objectives: To compare the efficiency of delivering increased semi- and non-urgent orthopaedic outpatient services through: (1) additional OPSC services; (2) additional traditional orthopaedic medical services with added surgical resources (TOMS + Surg); or (3) additional TOMS without added surgical resources (TOMS − Surg). Methods: A cost-utility analysis using discrete event simulation (DES) with dynamic queuing (DQ) was used to predict the cost effectiveness, throughput, queuing times, and resource utilisation, associated with introducing additional OPSC or TOMS ± Surg versus usual care. Results: The introduction of additional OPSC or TOMS (±surgery) would be considered cost effective in Australia. However, OPSC was the most cost-effective option. Increasing the capacity of current OPSC services is an efficient way to improve patient throughput and waiting times without exceeding current surgical resources. An OPSC capacity increase of ~100 patients per month appears cost effective (A$8546 per quality-adjusted life-year) and results in a high level of OPSC utilisation (98 %). Conclusion: Increasing OPSC capacity to manage semi- and non-urgent patients would be cost effective, improve throughput, and reduce waiting times without exceeding current surgical resources. Unlike Markov cohort modelling, microsimulation, or DES without DQ, employing DES-DQ in situations where capacity constraints predominate provides valuable additional information beyond cost effectiveness to guide resource allocation decisions. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",1,,"Australia; Capacity Building; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Mass Screening; Models, Economic; Needs Assessment; Orthopedics; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Physical Therapy Specialty; Queensland; Australia; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; human; major clinical study; medical service; model; outpatient; outpatient care; physiotherapy; quality adjusted life year; resource allocation; screening; surgery; capacity building; cost benefit analysis; economic model; economics; manpower; mass screening; needs assessment; organization and management; orthopedics; outpatient department; physiotherapy; procedures; Queensland; statistics and numerical data",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964545111

The aim of this study was to determine the micro cost differences of the Glasgow non-operative trauma virtual pathway in comparison to a traditional pathway. Design Discrete event simulation was used to model and analyse cost and resource utilisation with an activity-based costing approach. Data for a full comparison before the process change was unavailable so we used a modelling approach, comparing a virtual fracture clinic (VFC) with a simulated traditional fracture clinic (TFC). Setting The orthopaedic unit VFC pathway pioneered at Glasgow Royal Infirmary has attracted significant attention and interest and is the focus of this cost study. Outcome measures Our study focused exclusively on patients with non-operative trauma attending emergency department or the minor injuries unit and the subsequent step in the patient pathway. Retrospective studies of patient outcomes as a result of the protocol introductions for specific injuries are presented in association with activity costs from the models. Results Patients are satisfied with the new pathway, the information provided and the outcome of their injuries (Evidence Level IV). There was a 65% reduction in the number of first outpatient face-to-face (f2f) attendances in orthopaedics. In the VFC pathway, the resources required per day were significantly lower for all staff groups (p≤0.001). The overall cost per patient of the VFC pathway was £22.84 (95% CI 21.74 to 23.92) per patient compared with £36.81 (95% CI 35.65 to 37.97) for the TFC pathway. Conclusions Our results give a clearer picture of the cost comparison of the virtual pathway over a wholly traditional f2f clinic system. The use of simulation-based stochastic costings in healthcare economic analysis has been limited to date, but this study provides evidence for adoption of this method as a basis for its application in other healthcare settings. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Many Asian countries' healthcare systems have a mixed-type registration, accepting both walk-in patients and scheduled patients. This complex registration system causes a long patient waiting time in outpatient clinics. Different approaches have been proposed to reduce the waiting time. This study uses the integration of discrete event simulation (DES) and agent-based simulation (ABS) to improve patient waiting time and is the first attempt to apply this approach to solve this key problem faced by orthopedic departments. From the data collected, patient behaviors are modeled and incorporated into a massive agent-based simulation. The proposed approach is an aid for analyzing and modifying orthopedic department processes, allows us to consider far more details, and provides more reliable results. After applying the proposed approach, the total waiting time of the orthopedic department fell from 1246.39 minutes to 847.21 minutes.

In this paper, a novel simulation-optimisation (SO) framework is proposed focusing on the physical and process flows of patients in the design of a paediatric orthopaedic outpatient clinic. A discrete-event simulation model is used to estimate the frequency of movements between clinic units. The resulting information is utilised as input to a mixed integer programming (MIP) model, optimising the clinic layout design. In order to solve the MIP model, Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO), a metaheuristic approach enhanced with several heuristics is utilised. Finally, the optimisation model outputs are evaluated with the simulation model. The results demonstrate that improvements to the quality of the patient experience can be achieved through incorporating SO methods into the clinic layout design process. © 2019, © Operational Research Society 2019.",1,composition/decomposition heuristics; discrete-event simulation; mixed-integer programming; Outpatient clinic layout design; patient quality of care; simulation-optimisation,article; child; decomposition; discrete event simulation; human; metaheuristics; outpatient department; particle swarm optimization; timeliness (data),Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066428114

In this paper, a feedback-based hybrid modeling and simulation methodology has been developed, one that uses a system dynamics model for policy making and a discrete-event model for day-to-day clinic operations. This method is applied to support the formulation of overbooking policies in an Orthopedic clinic to achieve the strategic goal of a maximum appointment delay of 30 days. First, the system dynamics model is run to identify the best overall overbooking policy, which is then fed into the discrete-even model to evaluate its impact on day-to-day operations in terms of the patients' time in system. In this way, the policies developed by this hybrid modeling and simulation method address both the strategic (long-term) as well operational (short-term) goals of a clinic. Additionally, the approach also demonstrates that though overbooking is a commonly practiced to mitigate the negative effects of no-shows, it also can be an effective intervention strategy to reduce appointment delays.",1,Appointment schedule; Discrete-event simulation; Overbooking; System dynamics modeling,Exhibitions; System theory; Day-to-day operations; Discrete event models; Healthcare industry; Intervention strategy; Overbooking; Strategic goals; System dynamics model; System improvements; Discrete event simulation,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900305091

While prior literature has utilized discrete event simulation (DES) to study specific strategies such as scheduling and resource allocation, our study examines an earlier planning phase, assessing all workflow stages to determine the most impactful steps for subsequent strategy development. Methods: DES models real-world systems by simulating sequential events. We constructed a DES model for thoracic, gastrointestinal, and orthopedic surgeries summarized from a tertiary Chinese hospital. The model covers preoperative preparations, OR occupation, and OR preparation. Parameters were sourced from patient data and staff experience. Model outcome is OR throughput. Post-validation, scenario analyses were conducted for each department, including: (1) improving preoperative patient preparation time; (2) increasing PACU beds; (3) improving OR preparation time; (4) use of new equipment to reduce the operative time of a selected surgery type; three levels of improvement (slight, moderate, large) were investigated. Results: The first three improvement scenarios resulted in a 1%–5% increase in OR throughput across the three departments. Large reductions in operative time of the selected surgery types led to approximately 12%, 33%, and 38% increases in gastrointestinal, thoracic, and orthopedic surgery throughput, respectively. Moderate reductions resulted in 6%–17% increases in throughput and slight reductions of 1%–7%. Conclusions: The model could reliably reflect OR workflows of the three departments. Among the options investigated, model simulations suggest that improving OR preparation time and operative time are the most effective. © 2024 International Society of Surgery/Société Internationale de Chirurgie (ISS/SIC).",1,discrete event simulation; efficiency; hospital management; operating room; operations research,"Computer Simulation; Digestive System Surgical Procedures; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Operating Rooms; Operative Time; Orthopedic Procedures; Thoracic Surgical Procedures; Workflow; abdominal surgery; computer simulation; human; operation duration; organization and management; organizational efficiency; orthopedic surgery; procedures; thorax surgery; workflow",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193012989

Methods We applied discrete-event simulation modelling. The model was populated with real world data from a university hospital with a strong focus on reducing waiting time to surgery for patients with hip fracture. The system modelled concerned two patient groups that share the same OR resources: hip-fracture and other non-elective orthopaedic patients in need of surgical treatment. We simulated three scenarios based on the literature and interaction with staff and managers: (1) baseline; (2) reduced turnover time between surgeries by 20â €..min and (3) one extra OR during the day, Monday to Friday. The outcome variables were waiting time to surgery and the percentage of patients who waited longer than 24â €..hours for surgery. Results The mean waiting time in hours was significantly reduced from 16.2â €..hours in scenario 1 (baseline) to 13.3â €..hours in scenario 2 and 13.6â €..hours in scenario 3 for hip-fracture surgery and from 26.0â €..hours in baseline to 18.9â €..hours in scenario 2 and 18.5â €..hours in scenario 3 for other non-elective patients. The percentage of patients who were treated within 24â €..hours significantly increased from 86.4% (baseline) to 96.1% (scenario 2) and 95.1% (scenario 3) for hip-fracture patients and from 60.2% (baseline) to 79.8% (scenario 2) and 79.8% (scenario 3) for patients with other non-elective patients. Conclusions Healthcare managers who strive to improve the timelines of non-elective orthopaedic surgeries may benefit from using simulation modelling to analyse different strategies to support their decisions. In this specific case, the simulation results showed that the reduction of surgery turnover times could yield the same results as an extra OR. © 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",1,efficiency; operating room; orthopaedic surgery; Quality improvement; simulation modelling,"Computer Simulation; Efficiency; Hip Fractures; Hospitals, University; Humans; Operating Rooms; Orthopedic Procedures; Sweden; Time-to-Treatment; Workflow; Article; hip fracture; hospital management; human; model; operating room; orthopedic surgery; outcome variable; patient scheduling; personnel management; resource allocation; simulation; treatment planning; university hospital; workflow; computer simulation; hip fracture; organization and management; productivity; Sweden; time to treatment",Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017322814

Hospital operation models have been proposed to examine these healthcare procedures; however, they exhibit two fundamental gaps that hinder their ability to assess critical service areas after earthquakes. First, these models rest heavily on emergency procedures based on injury severity rather than type. Second, healthcare demands are often modeled from injury profiles after moderate earthquakes in the United States without including epidemiology data after large earthquakes globally. This approach has led to oversimplified hospital emergency services and resource utilization representation. This research presents a new hospital operations model based on patient injury type and worldwide earthquake epidemiology to fill these gaps. We build the model using discrete-event simulations to capture dynamic metrics on hospital operational outcomes after the earthquake, such as patient time-to-treatment and unassisted patient ratio. We then studied how these metrics vary with different levels of functional capacity in the specific hospital resources. Our results showed that waiting times for emergency department (ED)-level patients vary non-linearly with changes in the number of functional service areas. Also, significant reduction in the waiting time for hospital-level procedures was found for relatively small decrease in the bed occupancy rate, for example, if reverse triage procedures are activated (i.e. a discharge of non-critical patients admitted before the earthquake). Our findings provide a valuable tool for decision-making in hospital preparedness as they explicitly measure the impacts of functional capacity on key healthcare metrics for specific earthquake-related patients. © The Author(s) 2024.",0,disaster medicine; earthquake casualties; earthquake injured; hospital operations; Hospital resources,United States; Disaster prevention; Earthquake effects; Emergency rooms; Epidemiology; Orthopedics; Patient rehabilitation; Surgery; Disaster medicine; Earthquake casualty; Earthquake injured; Functional capacity; Hospital operations; Hospital resource; Operations Modeling; Resources based; Service area; Waiting time; disaster; earthquake event; epidemiology; health care; health services; hospital sector; modeling; Emergency services,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85202889574

It has shown efficiency benefits as it allows parallel processing of patients in a dedicated block room (BR). However, granular quantification of these benefits to hospital operations is lacking. The goal of this study was to determine the financial effect of establishing a BR using comprehensive operational modeling.Methods:A discrete-event simulation model of daily operating room (OR) patient flow for TJA procedures at a mid-sized hospital was developed. Two scenarios were tested: (1) without and (2) with a BR. Scenarios were compared according to staffing requirements, hours/day, and labor costs. The number of ORs and cases varied from 2 to 6 ORs performing 3 to 5 cases. These results were used as the inputs of a discounted cash flow (CF) model. Discounted CF model outputs were CF, net present value, internal rate of return, and return on investment.Results:Mean time savings of incorporating a BR were 68 min/d (range: 30 to 80 min/d), reducing the OR closing time by 1 hour. Incremental labor costs/day from nurse overtime pay ranged from $2,025 to $10,125 with no BR and $1,595 to $9,045 with a BR, which resulted in an increase in profit/day from $360 to $1,605. The CF/annum was $54,363, the net present value was $213,082, the internal rate of return was 12%, and the return on investment was 43.61%.Discussion:This study demonstrates that under all scenarios, a BR is more profitable than no BR to a hospital performing TJA via a bundled care or private payer remuneration model. A BR was shown to be financially net positive even when considering the necessary financial investment to establish it. In addition, this study demonstrates the potential of combining discrete-event simulation with financial analyses to assess various operational models of care to improve hospital efficiency, such as dedicated trauma rooms and swing rooms.  © American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.",1,,"Anesthesia, Conduction; Arthroplasty; Hospitals; Humans; Operating Rooms; arthroplasty; hospital; human; operating room; regional anesthesia",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134855101

Specifically we investigate the effect of resource flexibility on patient waiting time and throughput in an orthopedic care process. We further seek to explore on how implementation of resource flexibility on patient treatment processes affects patient access to healthcare services. We focus on two resources, namely, orthopedic surgeon and operating room. Methods: The observational approach was used to collect process data. The developed model was validated by comparing the simulation output with actual patient data collected from the studied orthopedic care process. We developed different scenarios to identify the best resource flexibility scenario and explore the effect of resource flexibility on patient waiting time, throughput, and future changes in demand. The developed scenarios focused on creating flexibility on service capacity of this care process by altering the amount of additional human resource capacity at different stages of patient care process and extending the use of operating room capacity. Results: The study found that resource flexibility can improve responsiveness to patient demand in the treatment process. Testing different scenarios showed that the introduction of resource flexibility reduces patient waiting time and improves throughput. The simulation results show that patient access to health services can be improved by implementing resource flexibility at different stages of the patient treatment process. Conclusion: This study contributes to the current health care literature by explaining how implementing resource flexibility at different stages of patient care processes can improve ability to respond to increasing patients demands. This study was limited to a single patient process; studies focusing on additional processes are recommended. © 2016 Simwita and Helgheim.",1,Agile strategy; Patient access; Responsiveness; Throughput; Waiting time,Article; controlled study; health care access; health care need; health care planning; health care utilization; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; operating room; orthopedic surgeon; patient care; simulation,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992756783

Methods An open-source, generalisable discrete-event simulation was developed, including a web-based application. The model used anonymised patient records between 2016 and 2019 of elective orthopaedic procedures from a National Health Service (NHS) Trust in England. In this paper, it is used to investigate scenarios including resourcing (beds and theatres) and productivity (lengths of stay, delayed discharges and theatre activity) to support planning for meeting new NHS targets aimed at reducing elective orthopaedic surgical backlogs in a proposed ring-fenced orthopaedic surgical facility. The simulation is interactive and intended for use by health service planners and clinicians. Results A higher number of beds (65-70) than the proposed number (40 beds) will be required if lengths of stay and delayed discharge rates remain unchanged. Reducing lengths of stay in line with national benchmarks reduces bed utilisation to an estimated 60%, allowing for additional theatre activity such as weekend working. Further, reducing the proportion of patients with a delayed discharge by 75% reduces bed utilisation to below 40%, even with weekend working. A range of other scenarios can also be investigated directly by NHS planners using the interactive web app. Conclusions The simulation model is intended to support capacity planning of orthopaedic elective services by identifying a balance of capacity across theatres and beds and predicting the impact of productivity measures on capacity requirements. It is applicable beyond the study site and can be adapted for other specialties.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

Commonly, these patients need to be seen again by a doctor or emergency nurse practitioner after an X-ray image has been taken in order to finalise the diagnosis and determine the next stage in the patients’ pathway. Here, significant waiting times can accrue for these follow-up consultations after radiographic imaging although the vast majority of patients are discharged. Research evidence from pilot studies suggests that patients with minor appendicular injuries could be safely discharged by a suitably qualified radiographer directly after imaging thereby avoiding queues for repeated consultation. In this study, we model patient pathways through an emergency department (ED) at a hospital in the South West of England using process mapping, interviews with ED staff and discrete event simulation (DES). The DES model allowed us to compare the current practice at the hospital with scenarios using radiographer-led discharge of patients directly after imaging and assess the reduction in patients’ length of stay in ED. We also quantified trade-offs between the provision of radiographer-led discharge and its effects, i.e. reduction in waiting times and ED workload. Finally, we discuss how this decision support tool can be used to support understanding for patients and members of staff. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",1,Case study; Discrete event simulation; Early discharge; Emergency department,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044262406

For the above reasons, it is essential to understand and plan the whole surgical path (patient and personnel) by avoiding foreseeable inefficiencies, delays and risks. Hence, the aim of this study is fully modeling a generic orthopedics OT in order to support hospital decision makers in OT design and activity planning for both regular and emergency scenarios. In order to do that and due to the complexity of the OT system, a simulation approach is fundamental for properly understanding the whole process and for clearly controlling and analyzing all the factors involved (surgical durations, types, working times and rooms availability, etc..). Discrete event models have been found reliable and accurate to simulate complex health systems (e.g. emergency management, beds management, logistic and assets estimation, etc.). Finally, after selecting the most appropriate type of model, and using past surgical data and experts’ opinions from the hospital for its development and implementation, a more precise and reliable clinical validation of the model is currently in progress, by concluding a data verification that needs a period of on-site data collection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",1,Decision support system; Operating theater management; Process simulation; Surgical activity planning,Artificial intelligence; Biomedical engineering; Civil defense; Decision support systems; Disasters; Discrete event simulation; Hospitals; Human resource management; Orthopedics; Risk management; Surgery; Theaters; Activity planning; Clinical validations; Discrete event models; Emergency management; Process simulations; Simulation-based modeling; Technical requirement; Technology equipment; Decision making,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944325103
