Operating rooms can be configured as flexible and handle both electives and emergencies, or as dedicated to focus on either electives or emergencies. With flexible rooms, the prioritization of emergencies over scheduled electives can lead to schedule disruptions. Focused rooms can lead to imbalances between capacity and surgery workload. Whereas hospital administrators typically handle this trade-off by employing either flexible rooms (complete flexibility) or dedicated rooms (complete focus), we investigate whether a combination of flexible and dedicated rooms (partial flexibility) could be a preferable alternative. The ensuing question is what is the right combination of flexible and dedicated rooms? A versatile simulation model is developed to evaluate different resource allocation policies under various environmental parameters and performance metrics, including patient wait time, staff overtime, and operating room utilization. The main result is that partial flexibility configurations outperform both complete flexibility and complete focus policies by providing solutions with improved values of expected wait time for both emergency and elective patients.","2014-10-28","2025-02-24 19:15:58","2025-02-24 19:15:58","","819-847","","","45","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Workload; Operations management; Resource allocation; Computer science; Flexibility (engineering); Schedule; Focus (computing); Prioritization; Wait time","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, there is no objective method for the assessment and design of operating room setups for different surgical disciplines and intervention types available. The aim of this work is to establish an improved OR setup for common procedures in arthroplasty. With the help of computer simulation, a method for the design and assessment of enhanced OR setups was developed. New OR setups were designed, analyzed in a computer simulation environment and evaluated in the actual intraoperative setting. Thereby, a 3D graphical simulation representation enabled the strong involvement of clinical stakeholders in all phases of the design and decision-making process of the new setup alternatives. The implementation of improved OR setups reduces the instrument handover time between the surgeon and the scrub nurse, the travel paths of the OR team as well as shortens the procedure duration. Additionally, the ergonomics of the OR staff were improved. The developed simulation method was evaluated in the actual intraoperative setting and proved its benefit for the design and optimization of OR setups for different surgical intervention types. As a clinical result, enhanced setups for total knee arthroplasty and total hip arthroplasty surgeries were established in daily clinical routine and the OR efficiency was improved.","2020-07-02","2025-02-24 19:15:59","2025-02-24 19:15:59","","145","","","20","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Discrete event simulation; Workflow; Arthroplasty; Operating room management; Surgical process optimization; Surgical workflow simulation; Computer science; Health informatics; Reliability engineering; Process (computing); Handover; Surgical team","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With patient visits projected to increase substantially in the coming years, the clinics seek process improvements that will accommodate growth and sustain strong patient satisfaction well into the future. This paper describes a simulation study of patient flows in the clinics under various future demand scenarios, including alternative patient volumes and no-show rates. The study explored the impact of best practices for in-clinic task management, patient and staff scheduling, and patient communications. Key performance measures included patient waiting times, total time in clinic, facility utilization, and on-time clinic closings. The model was developed based on patient schedule and tracking data. The results of the simulation model and clinic observations provided evidence to support multiple process improvements within the clinics. Introducing an additional front desk attendant in each clinic during busy times to assist with incoming phone calls and patient check-ins will allow for patients to be seen sooner and for more efficient appointment scheduling. Altering appointment time slots from 15 minutes to 10 minutes and distributing scheduled appointments more evenly throughout the day will allow providers to see more patients and reduce the need for overbooking, effectively decreasing patient waiting time. Based on the results of our analysis, implementing these changes to the clinics may allow for future growth while preserving patient satisfaction.","2016-04","2025-02-24 19:16:00","2025-02-24 19:16:00","","124-129","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Operations management; Patient satisfaction; Outpatient clinic; Medicine; Scheduling (computing); Desk; Sports medicine; Best practice; Phone; Task management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Improving utilization of existing workforce capacity can reduce the existing gap between surgical demand and available workforce capacity. In this paper, the authors use discrete event simulation to explore the care process at an orthopedic department. Our main focus is improving utilization of surgeons while minimizing patient wait time. Methods The authors collaborated with orthopedic department personnel to map the current operations of orthopedic care process in order to identify factors that influence poor surgeons utilization and high patient waiting time. The authors used an observational approach to collect data. The developed model was validated by comparing the simulation output with the actual patient data that were collected from the studied orthopedic care process. The authors developed a proposal scenario to show how to improve surgeon utilization. Results The simulation results showed that if ancillary services could be performed before the start of clinic examination services, the orthopedic care process could be highly improved. That is, improved surgeon utilization and reduced patient waiting time. Simulation results demonstrate that with improved surgeon utilizations, up to 55% increase of future demand can be accommodated without patients reaching current waiting time at this clinic, thus, improving patient access to health care services. Conclusion This study shows how simulation modeling can be used to improve health care processes. This study was limited to a single care process; however the findings can be applied to improve other orthopedic care process with similar operational characteristics.","2016-10-05","2025-02-24 19:16:01","2025-02-24 19:16:01","","41-50","","","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Discrete event simulation; waiting time; Operations management; Human resources; Simulation modeling; Health care; Workforce; Observational study; Medicine; Emergency medicine; Orthopedic surgery; health care process; Orthopedic department; patient","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Survey of outpatient satisfaction showed that at Taoyuan Armed Forces General Hospital the long waiting time is by far the most dissatisfied service quality. Current data shows those outpatients need to wait for an average of up to two hours before being served. In attempt to reduce outpatient waiting time, we proposed a genuine agent-based adoptive scheduling model for service sectors within which fixed scheduling rules will not work because humans are autonomous and their behavior will change according to the real-time situation and the scheduling rules applied. The proposed model uses software agents to dynamically adjust the scheduling rules to adapt to the real-time situation in the clinic. Simulation models were built based on two months of data collected manually from the hospital to test the proposed model.

Design of experiments is used to study the effects of factors and their interactions. Experiments are input to modified TOPSIS as alternatives to be compared based on multiple correlated performance measures. A case study is presented at Educational Dentistry Clinics in Jordan.

The aim of this study was to determine the micro cost differences of the Glasgow non-operative trauma virtual pathway in comparison to a traditional pathway. Design Discrete event simulation was used to model and analyse cost and resource utilisation with an activity-based costing approach. Data for a full comparison before the process change was unavailable so we used a modelling approach, comparing a virtual fracture clinic (VFC) with a simulated traditional fracture clinic (TFC). Setting The orthopaedic unit VFC pathway pioneered at Glasgow Royal Infirmary has attracted significant attention and interest and is the focus of this cost study. Outcome measures Our study focused exclusively on patients with non-operative trauma attending emergency department or the minor injuries unit and the subsequent step in the patient pathway. Retrospective studies of patient outcomes as a result of the protocol introductions for specific injuries are presented in association with activity costs from the models. Results Patients are satisfied with the new pathway, the information provided and the outcome of their injuries (Evidence Level IV). There was a 65% reduction in the number of first outpatient face-to-face (f2f) attendances in orthopaedics. In the VFC pathway, the resources required per day were significantly lower for all staff groups (p≤0.001). The overall cost per patient of the VFC pathway was £22.84 (95% CI 21.74 to 23.92) per patient compared with £36.81 (95% CI 35.65 to 37.97) for the TFC pathway. Conclusions Our results give a clearer picture of the cost comparison of the virtual pathway over a wholly traditional f2f clinic system. The use of simulation-based stochastic costings in healthcare economic analysis has been limited to date, but this study provides evidence for adoption of this method as a basis for its application in other healthcare settings.","2017-09-07","2025-02-24 19:16:09","2025-02-24 19:16:09","","1-12","","","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Discrete event simulation; Emergency department; costs; Medical emergency; Health care; Pediatrics; Medicine; Resource (project management); Retrospective cohort study; Orthopedic surgery; orthopaedics; Activity-based costing; fracture clinic; Protocol (science); outpatients; patient outcomes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulation modelling has been used to inform the optimal scale and professional mix of services required to match patient demand. The context and the value of simulation modelling in service planning remain unclear. We aimed to examine the adoption, context and costs of using simulation modelling recommendations to inform service planning. Methods: Using an implementation science approach, we undertook a prospective, qualitative evaluation to assess the use of discrete event simulation modelling recommendations for service re-design and to explore stakeholder perspectives about the role of simulation modelling in service planning. Five orthopaedic and neurosurgical services in Queensland, Australia, were selected to maximise variation in implementation effectiveness. We used the consolidated framework for implementation research (CFIR) to guide the facilitation and analysis of the stakeholder focus group discussions. We conducted a prospective costing analysis in each service to estimate the costs associated with using simulation modelling to inform service planning. Results: Four of the five services demonstrated adoption by inclusion of modelling recommendations into proposals for service re-design. Four CFIR constructs distinguished and two CFIR constructs did not distinguish between high versus mixed implementation effectiveness. We identified additional constructs that did not map onto CFIR. The mean cost of implementation was AU$34,553 per site (standard deviation = AU$737). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first time the context of implementing simulation modelling recommendations in a health care setting, using a validated framework, has been examined. Our findings may provide valuable insights to increase the uptake of healthcare modelling recommendations in service planning.","2019-08-09","2025-02-24 19:16:11","2025-02-24 19:16:11","","78-78","","","14","","","","","","","","","","en, en","","","","","","","","","","","Discrete event simulation; Costs; Economic evaluation; Hospital; Implementation; Neurosurgery; Orthopaedics; Physiotherapy; Health care; Process management; Medicine; Health services research; Service (business); Context (language use); Stakeholder; Focus group; Activity-based costing; Implementation research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We applied discrete-event simulation modelling. The model was populated with real world data from a university hospital with a strong focus on reducing waiting time to surgery for patients with hip fracture. The system modelled concerned two patient groups that share the same OR resources: hip-fracture and other non-elective orthopaedic patients in need of surgical treatment. We simulated three scenarios based on the literature and interaction with staff and managers: (1) baseline; (2) reduced turnover time between surgeries by 20 min and (3) one extra OR during the day, Monday to Friday. The outcome variables were waiting time to surgery and the percentage of patients who waited longer than 24 hours for surgery. Results The mean waiting time in hours was significantly reduced from 16.2 hours in scenario 1 (baseline) to 13.3 hours in scenario 2 and 13.6 hours in scenario 3 for hip-fracture surgery and from 26.0 hours in baseline to 18.9 hours in scenario 2 and 18.5 hours in scenario 3 for other non-elective patients. The percentage of patients who were treated within 24 hours significantly increased from 86.4% (baseline) to 96.1% (scenario 2) and 95.1% (scenario 3) for hip-fracture patients and from 60.2% (baseline) to 79.8% (scenario 2) and 79.8% (scenario 3) for patients with other non-elective patients. Conclusions Healthcare managers who strive to improve the timelines of non-elective orthopaedic surgeries may benefit from using simulation modelling to analyse different strategies to support their decisions. In this specific case, the simulation results showed that the reduction of surgery turnover times could yield the same results as an extra OR.","2017-04-07","2025-02-24 19:16:12","2025-02-24 19:16:12","","e013303","","","7","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Simulation modelling; Operations management; Health care; simulation modelling; efficiency; Medicine; Orthopedic surgery; Surgery; Hip fracture; Quality management; Baseline (configuration management); University hospital; Schedule (workplace); Quality improvement; operating room; orthopaedic surgery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the UK, the allocation of capital funds to increase capacity for managing elective waits has created planning and operational challenges for health services. This paper reports on the development and deployment of an interactive web-based discrete-event simulation model for supporting capacity planning of surgical activity and ward stay in a proposed new ring-fenced orthopedic facility in a UK health service. The model is free and open-source and developed to be generic and applicable for new capacity planning of elective recovery in orthopedics in other regions. With minor adaptations it can also be readily modified for application to other specialties. Given the current relevance of managing record elective waiting lists, there is potential widespread applicability of the simulation model which is supported by our open approach to modeling.","2023-12-10","2025-02-24 19:16:16","2025-02-24 19:16:16","","1077-1087","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Simulation; Capacity planning; Discrete event simulation; Operations management; Operations research; Computer science; Medicine; Orthopedic surgery; Surgery; Physics; Engineering; Event (particle physics); Quantum mechanics; Law; Operating system; Political science; Software deployment; Relevance (law)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This complex registration system causes a long patient waiting time in outpatient clinics. Different approaches have been proposed to reduce the waiting time. This study uses the integration of discrete event simulation (DES) and agent-based simulation (ABS) to improve patient waiting time and is the first attempt to apply this approach to solve this key problem faced by orthopedic departments. From the data collected, patient behaviors are modeled and incorporated into a massive agent-based simulation. The proposed approach is an aid for analyzing and modifying orthopedic department processes, allows us to consider far more details, and provides more reliable results. After applying the proposed approach, the total waiting time of the orthopedic department fell from 1246.39 minutes to 847.21 minutes.

In many Asian countries, healthcare system has a mixed-type registration which accepts for both walk-in patients and scheduled patients. It is different from western countries which accept only scheduled patients. A long waiting time (WT) of outpatient clinics is caused by this complex registration system. A survey questionnaire of patient satisfaction showed that the long waiting time is the most dissatisfied service quality for healthcare providers. This study focused on improving clinical services by using collaborative approaches to reduce outpatient waiting time for the healthcare providers. The collaborative approaches are scheduling approach with results presented in this paper and agent-based collaborative control system which is currently in progress. We collected and observed data for two months from real world situation and used data from hospital database for building and validating simulation models. Seven scheduling scenarios are performed: scenarios I adjusted proportion between walk-in patients and scheduled patients, scenario II-VI adjusted patient sequencing, and scenario VII adjusted late rate and applied a late policy for late patients. The scenario I (adjusting the proportion: 10% for walk-in patients and 90% for scheduled patients) has the highest percentage of waiting time improvement (average: 37.13 % for walk-in patients and 50.82 % for scheduled patients) compared with the other scenarios.

A common data-set comparing usual orthopedic care (UC) to an orthopedic physiotherapy screening clinic and multidisciplinary treatment service (OPSC) was used to develop a MM and a DES without (DES-no-DQ) and with DQ (DES-DQ). Model results were then compared in detail. The MM predicted an incremental CE ratio (ICER) of $495 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for OPSC over UC. The DES-no-DQ showed OPSC dominating UC; the DES-DQ generated an ICER of $2342 per QALY. The MM and DES-no-DQ ICER estimates differed due to the MM having implicit delays built into its structure as a result of having fixed cycle lengths, which are not a feature of DES. The non-DQ models assume that queues are at a steady state. Conversely, queues in the DES-DQ develop flexibly with supply and demand for resources, in this case, leading to different estimates of resource use and CE. The choice of MM or DES (with or without DQ) would not alter the reimbursement of OPSC as it was highly cost-effective compared to UC in all analyses. However, the modeling method may influence decisions where ICERs are closer to the CE acceptability threshold, or where capacity constraints and DQ are important features of the system. In these cases, DES-DQ would be the preferred modeling technique to avoid incorrect resource allocation decisions.","2015-12-29","2025-02-24 19:16:25","2025-02-24 19:16:25","","33-47","","","18","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","","","","","","","Discrete event simulation; DES; Cost-effectiveness; Resource allocation; Statistics; Cost effectiveness; Queue; Markov chain; Queueing theory; Computer science; Quality-adjusted life year; Cost–benefit analysis; Dynamic queuing; Markov cohort","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
