# SCOPE: Simulation for Coordination of Orthopaedic Patient Elective Services

This repository serves as supplementary material for the paper:

>**Mapping Applications of Computer Simulation in Orthopedic Services: A Topic Modeling Approach**. 

 **This work has been supported by the LEAP Digital Health Hub,
which has been funded by EPSRC under grant number EP/X031349/1**


The paper used a topic modelling approach to examine and map the computational simulation literature applied to operational-level orthopedics services, combined with a structured analysis of the papers.

## Running the analysis

To run the files, clone or download the project, open the project in R and run:

```
renv::restore()
```

This will install the package versions recorded in the renv.lock file.

### Documents included in analysis

Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that identifies underlying themes or topics
in large text datasets by grouping related words and concepts. Topic modeling was performed using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), implemented via Gibbs sampling in R v4.4.2. Dominant topics per document are included in the table below.
